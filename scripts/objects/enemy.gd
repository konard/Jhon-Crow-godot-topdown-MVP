## Enemy AI with tactical behaviors including patrol, guard, cover, and flanking.
##
## Supports multiple behavior modes:
## - PATROL: Moves between patrol points
## - GUARD: Stands in place watching for the player
##
## Tactical features:
## - Uses cover when under fire (suppression)
## - Attempts to flank the player from the sides
## - Coordinates with other enemies (optional)
## - GOAP foundation for goal-oriented planning

## AI States for tactical behavior.
enum AIState {
	IDLE,       ## Default idle state (patrol or guard)
	COMBAT,     ## Actively engaging the player (coming out of cover, shooting 2-3s, returning)
	SEEKING_COVER,  ## Moving to cover position
	IN_COVER,   ## Taking cover from player fire
	FLANKING,   ## Attempting to flank the player
	SUPPRESSED, ## Under fire, staying in cover
	RETREATING, ## Retreating to cover while possibly shooting
	PURSUING,   ## Moving cover-to-cover toward player (when far and can't hit)
	ASSAULT     ## Coordinated multi-enemy assault (rush player after 5s wait)
}

## Retreat behavior modes based on damage taken.
enum RetreatMode {

	ONE_HIT,        ## One hit taken - quick burst then retreat without shooting
