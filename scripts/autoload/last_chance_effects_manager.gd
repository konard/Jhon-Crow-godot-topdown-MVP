## LastChanceEffectsManager - Special "last chance" effect for hard difficulty.
##
## This autoload singleton manages the special time-freeze effect that triggers
## on hard difficulty when the player is about to die (1 HP or less) and an
## enemy bullet on a collision course enters their threat sphere.
##
## Effect details (as per issue #167):
## 1. Time completely stops for 6 real seconds
## 2. Player can move at normal speed and shoot during the freeze
## 3. Player-fired bullets stay frozen in place until time unfreezes
## 4. All colors except the player are dimmed
## 5. Blue sepia effect overlay with a ripple effect
## 6. This effect triggers ONLY ONCE per life

## Duration of the time freeze in real seconds.

## Blue sepia intensity for the shader (0.0-1.0).
const SEPIA_INTENSITY: float = 0.7
