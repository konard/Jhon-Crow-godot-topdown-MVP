## Auto-cleanup script for one-shot particle effects.

## Automatically frees the particle effect node after its lifetime expires.
## Attach this script to any one-shot GPUParticles2D node.

## Extra time after lifetime before cleanup (allows particles to fade).

	var total_wait := lifetime + cleanup_delay
