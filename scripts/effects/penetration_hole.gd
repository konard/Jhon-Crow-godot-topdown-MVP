extends Area2D
## Permanent penetration hole that creates a gap in wall collision.
##
## This creates an actual hole in the wall that allows:
## - Bullets to pass through without triggering new penetration
## - Vision/raycasts to pass through
## - Enemies to see and shoot through
##
## The hole is permanent and does not fade over time.
## Similar to Red Faction Guerrilla or Teardown destruction (without physics).
##
## The visual is a semi-transparent dark trail from entry to exit point,
## representing the bullet path through the wall material.

## Collision layers this hole affects (default: obstacles layer 3)
const OBSTACLE_LAYER: int = 4  # Layer 3 in Godot is value 4 (2^2)

## The collision shape of this hole.
var _collision_shape: CollisionShape2D = null

## The visual Line2D trail.
var _visual_line: Line2D = null

## Visual material for the hole effect.
## Note: True texture erasing would require CanvasGroup masking or
## rendering walls to a SubViewport with a mask layer.
## For simplicity, we use a dark semi-transparent line to represent the hole.
var _visual_material: CanvasItemMaterial = null

## Direction the bullet was traveling (for trail orientation).
var bullet_direction: Vector2 = Vector2.RIGHT

## Width of the bullet trail (based on caliber).
var trail_width: float = 4.0

## Length of the trail (based on penetration distance traveled).
var trail_length: float = 8.0

## Entry point in global coordinates (stored for visual rendering).
var _entry_point: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO

## Exit point in global coordinates (stored for visual rendering).
var _exit_point: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO

## Whether the hole has been fully configured.
var _is_configured: bool = false

## Creates or updates the visual representation of the hole.
## The visual is drawn in GLOBAL coordinates as a line from entry to exit.
