extends RigidBody2D
class_name GrenadeBase
## Abstract base class for all grenades.
##
## Handles common grenade mechanics:
## - Timer-based detonation (4 seconds)
## - Physics-based throwing with drag distance/direction determining velocity
## - Explosion sound audible at 2 viewport distance
## - Max throw distance = viewport length
## - Min throw distance = at player feet (short drag)
##
## Subclasses should override:
## - _on_explode(): Define explosion effects
## - _get_effect_radius(): Define effect area

## Time until explosion in seconds (starts when timer is activated).
@export var fuse_time: float = 4.0

## Maximum throw speed in pixels per second.
## At max speed with default friction (300), grenade travels ~1200px (viewport width).
## Formula: max_distance = max_throw_speed² / (2 × ground_friction)
@export var max_throw_speed: float = 850.0

## Minimum throw speed for a minimal drag (gentle lob).
@export var min_throw_speed: float = 100.0

## Drag multiplier to convert drag distance to throw speed (DEPRECATED - kept for compatibility).
## At viewport width (~1280px) drag, reaches near max speed.
## At ~100px drag (short swing), produces gentle throw.
@export var drag_to_speed_multiplier: float = 2.0

## Mass of the grenade in kg. Affects how mouse velocity translates to throw velocity.
## Heavier grenades require more "swing momentum" to achieve full velocity transfer.
## Light grenade (0.2kg) = quick flick throw, Heavy grenade (0.6kg) = needs full swing.
@export var grenade_mass: float = 0.4

## Multiplier to convert mouse velocity (pixels/second) to throw velocity.
## This is the base ratio before mass adjustment.
## Lower values = require faster mouse movement for maximum throw (easier to control strength).
## At 0.5: max throw requires ~2700 px/s mouse velocity for 1352 px/s throw speed.
## This allows for a wider range of controllable throw distances.
@export var mouse_velocity_to_throw_multiplier: float = 0.5

## Minimum swing distance (in pixels) required for full velocity transfer at grenade's mass.
## For a 0.4kg grenade, need ~80px of mouse movement to transfer full velocity.
## Reduced from 200px to allow quick flicks to throw reasonably far.
## Formula: actual_min_swing = min_swing_distance * (grenade_mass / 0.4)
@export var min_swing_distance: float = 80.0

## Minimum transfer efficiency (0.0 to 1.0) for any intentional throw.
## This ensures quick flicks with high velocity still result in a reasonable throw distance.
## Set to 0.35 to guarantee at least 35% velocity transfer for any swing > 10px.
@export var min_transfer_efficiency: float = 0.35

## Friction/damping applied to slow the grenade.
## Higher friction = shorter throw distance for same speed.
## Formula: max_distance = max_throw_speed² / (2 × ground_friction)
## Default 300 with 850 speed → max distance ~1200px (viewport width).
@export var ground_friction: float = 300.0

## Bounce coefficient when hitting walls (0.0 = no bounce, 1.0 = full bounce).
@export var wall_bounce: float = 0.4

## Sound range multiplier (2 = audible at 2 viewport distance).
@export var sound_range_multiplier: float = 2.0

## Minimum velocity to trigger landing sound (prevents multiple triggers).
@export var landing_velocity_threshold: float = 50.0

## Whether the grenade timer has been activated.
var _timer_active: bool = false

## Time remaining until explosion.
var _time_remaining: float = 0.0

## Whether the grenade has exploded.
var _has_exploded: bool = false

## Reference to the sprite for visual feedback.
@onready var _sprite: Sprite2D = $Sprite2D if has_node("Sprite2D") else null

## Blink timer for visual feedback when about to explode.
var _blink_timer: float = 0.0

## Blink interval - gets faster as explosion approaches.
var _blink_interval: float = 0.5

## Track if landing sound has been played (grenade has come to rest).
var _has_landed: bool = false

## Track if activation sound has been played.
var _activation_sound_played: bool = false

## Track previous velocity for landing detection.
var _previous_velocity: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO

## Signal emitted when the grenade explodes.
signal exploded(position: Vector2, grenade: GrenadeBase)
