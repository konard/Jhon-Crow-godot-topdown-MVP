## Conclusion

The first AI solution draft attempt was IMMEDIATELY interrupted by a rate limit error.
The Claude API returned a rate limit message within 454ms of starting.
No actual work was performed - the AI never got to analyze the issue or write any code.
The CLAUDE.md file was created and then immediately reverted in the same session.
