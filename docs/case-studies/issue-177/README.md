# Case Study: Issue #177 - Flashbang Grenade Not Working

## Problem Summary
The flashbang grenade feature was implemented in GDScript but the player could not use grenades in the game. Users reported:
- Tutorial is present
- Grenade does not appear or work
- Multiple attempts of the control sequence produced no result

## Timeline of Events

### Initial Implementation (commits ad09b21 and 9acb5da)
1. Grenade system was added to `scripts/characters/player.gd` (GDScript)
2. `GrenadeBase.gd` and `FlashbangGrenade.gd` were created
3. Tutorial was added to `scripts/levels/tutorial_level.gd`
4. Input actions `grenade_prepare` (G key) and `grenade_throw` (RMB) were added to `project.godot`

### User Testing
User (Jhon-Crow) reported in PR #180 comments:
- Log files: `game_log_20260121_165728.txt` and `game_log_20260121_165904.txt`
- No grenade-related log entries appeared despite multiple attempts

## Root Cause Analysis

### Evidence from Logs
The user's game logs showed:
- Standard game startup messages
- GUNSHOT sounds from AssaultRifle
- **ZERO grenade-related log entries**

Expected log entries that were missing:
- `[Player] Ready! Grenades: 3/3`
- `[Player.Grenade] Step 1 started...`
- `[GrenadeBase] Timer activated!`

### Investigation

1. **Checked Player.tscn**: Found it uses `scripts/characters/player.gd`
2. **Checked Level Scenes**: Found they use a **different** player scene!

```bash
$ grep -h "Player" scenes/levels/*.tscn
[ext_resource type="PackedScene" path="res://scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn" id="2_player"]
```

### Root Cause Identified
**The level scenes (`BuildingLevel.tscn`, `TestTier.tscn`) use `scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn` which is attached to `Scripts/Characters/Player.cs` (C#), NOT `scripts/characters/player.gd` (GDScript).**

The grenade system was implemented in the GDScript player, but the actual game uses the C# player which had **no grenade functionality**.

## Architecture Issue
The project has two player implementations:
1. `scenes/characters/Player.tscn` + `scripts/characters/player.gd` (GDScript)
2. `scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn` + `Scripts/Characters/Player.cs` (C#)

The levels reference the C# version, but new features were added to the GDScript version.

## Solution
Added the complete 3-step grenade throwing mechanic to `Scripts/Characters/Player.cs`:

### Changes Made
1. Added grenade-related fields:
   - `GrenadeScene` (PackedScene export)
   - `MaxGrenades` (configurable, default 3)
   - `_currentGrenades` (current count)
   - `_grenadeState` (state machine)
   - `_activeGrenade` (reference to held grenade)

2. Added grenade state machine:
   - `GrenadeState.Idle` - waiting for input
   - `GrenadeState.TimerStarted` - pin pulled, timer running
   - `GrenadeState.Preparing` - LMB held
   - `GrenadeState.ReadyToAim` - LMB + RMB held
   - `GrenadeState.Aiming` - ready to throw

3. Implemented 3-step throwing mechanic:
   - Step 1: G + RMB drag right -> starts 4s timer
   - Step 2: LMB held -> RMB pressed -> LMB released -> prepare
   - Step 3: RMB held -> drag and release -> throw

4. Added signals:
   - `GrenadeChangedEventHandler(int current, int maximum)`
   - `GrenadeThrownEventHandler()`

5. Added logging via `LogToFile()` method for debugging

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dual Implementation Risk**: Having both GDScript and C# implementations of the same component creates maintenance burden and risk of features being added to the wrong version.

2. **Integration Testing**: Features should be tested in the actual game context, not just in isolation. The GDScript implementation may have worked in unit tests but never executed in the real game.

3. **Log Analysis is Critical**: The absence of expected log messages was the key indicator that the code wasn't running at all, pointing to a scene/script binding issue rather than a logic bug.

4. **Architecture Documentation**: Projects with mixed language implementations should clearly document which versions are used where.

## Files Changed
- `Scripts/Characters/Player.cs` - Added complete grenade system (~400 lines)

## Log Files
- `logs/game_log_20260121_165728.txt` - First test session
- `logs/game_log_20260121_165904.txt` - Second test session with multiple attempts
- `logs/game_log_20260121_185409.txt` - Third test session (throwing issues reported)

# Follow-Up: Throwing Mechanics Issues (2026-01-21)

## Reported Problems
User (Jhon-Crow) reported in PR #180 comments at 2026-01-21T16:00:29Z:
1. **Slow swings produce fast throws**: "бросок при медленном размахе должен быть медленным и граната должна лететь не далеко" (slow swing throws should be slow and grenade should not fly far)
2. **Throwing upward doesn't work**: "бросок вверх всё ещё не работает"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: All Throws Are at Maximum Speed

**Evidence from logs** (`game_log_20260121_185409.txt`):
```
[GrenadeBase] Thrown! Direction: (0.989059, -0.147522), Speed: 3840.0
[GrenadeBase] Thrown! Direction: (0.97786, -0.209259), Speed: 3840.0
[GrenadeBase] Thrown! Direction: (0.154324, -0.98802), Speed: 3840.0
```
Every throw had the same speed: 3840.0 (the maximum), regardless of drag distance.

**Root Cause**: Double multiplication of sensitivity multipliers:
1. In `Player.cs` line 1097: `adjustedDragDistance = dragDistance * 9.0f`
2. In `grenade_base.gd` line 109: `throw_speed = drag_distance * drag_to_speed_multiplier` (12.0)

Result: Even a short drag of 50px → 50 * 9 * 12 = 5400, clamped to max 3840.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Removed the 9x multiplier from `Player.cs`
2. Set reasonable values in `grenade_base.gd`:
   - `max_throw_speed`: 3840 → 2500 (still travels far enough)
   - `min_throw_speed`: 150 → 100 (gentler minimum)
   - `drag_to_speed_multiplier`: 12 → 2 (linear mapping: ~1250px drag = max speed)

### Issue 2: Throwing Upward "Doesn't Work"

**Evidence from logs**:
```
Direction: (0.15432426, -0.9880203)  // Nearly straight up
Player rotated for throw: 0 -> -1.4158529
[GrenadeBase] Thrown! Direction: (0.154324, -0.98802), Speed: 3840.0
```
The grenade IS thrown upward (negative Y = up in Godot), so the direction was correct.

**Root Cause**: Grenade collision_mask = 7 (layers 1|2|4 = player|enemies|obstacles).
When thrown upward, the grenade could immediately collide with the player's collision shape, even with a 60px spawn offset.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Changed `collision_mask` from 7 to 6 (layers 2|4 = enemies|obstacles only)
2. Grenades no longer physically collide with the player, allowing throws in any direction

## Technical Details

### Before Fix (Speed Calculation)
```
Drag: 194px
C# multiplier: 194 * 9 = 1746
GDScript: 1746 * 12 = 20952 → clamped to 3840
Result: Short drag = max speed ❌
```

### After Fix (Speed Calculation)
```
Drag: 194px
No C# multiplier
GDScript: 194 * 2 = 388
Result: Short drag = slow throw ✓

Drag: 1000px (long swing)
GDScript: 1000 * 2 = 2000
Result: Long drag = fast throw ✓

Drag: 1300px (full swing)
GDScript: 1300 * 2 = 2600 → clamped to 2500
Result: Maximum throw speed ✓
```

### Collision Layers Reference
| Layer | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1     | 1     | Player      |
| 2     | 2     | Enemies     |
| 3     | 4     | Obstacles   |
| 6     | 32    | Grenades    |
