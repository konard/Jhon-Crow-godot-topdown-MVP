## Summary
- Created `shotgun_topdown.png` (64x16) for in-hand top-down view during gameplay
- Created `shotgun_icon.png` (80x24) for armory menu matching M16 style
- Added `ShotgunSprite` node to `Shotgun.tscn` scene
- Updated `armory_menu.gd` to use the new shotgun icon

## Design Details
The sprites feature a pump-action shotgun design matching the reference model:
- Wooden stock and forend (brown tones)
- Metal receiver and barrel (gray tones)
- Style consistent with existing M16 rifle sprites

### Shotgun Sprites Comparison
| Sprite | Size | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `shotgun_topdown.png` | 64x16 | In-hand view (top-down perspective) |
| `shotgun_icon.png` | 80x24 | Armory menu icon (side view) |

The design follows the same style as the M16 rifle sprites (`m16_rifle_topdown.png` and `m16_rifle.png`).

## Test Plan
- [ ] Verify shotgun displays correct sprite when equipped in-game
- [ ] Verify shotgun icon appears correctly in armory menu
- [ ] Verify sprite positioning matches assault rifle (offset: 20, 0)
