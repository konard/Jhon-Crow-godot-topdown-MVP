# Case Study: Issue #194 - Add Shotgun

## Executive Summary

This case study analyzes the feature request to add a shotgun weapon to the godot-topdown-MVP game. The analysis includes codebase exploration, online research, timeline reconstruction, and proposed implementation solutions.

## Request Translation

The owner requests a shotgun with the following specifications:

### Weapon Properties
| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Fire Mode | Semi-automatic | Limited by player skill |
| Pellets | 6-12 random | Per shot |
| Spread | 15 degrees | Cone angle |
| Spread Type | Always medium | No dynamic spread |
| Ricochet Max Angle | 35 degrees | Limited deflection |
| Wall Penetration | None | Cannot go through walls |
| Screen Shake | Large | Single recoil effect |
| Laser Sight | None | No aiming laser |
| Sound | Assault rifle level | Same loudness |
| Capacity | 8 shells | Tube magazine |
| Model | None yet | Visual model postponed |

### Control Scheme

**Reload Sequence:**
1. RMB drag down (open action)
2. MMB → RMB drag down (load shell, repeat 8x)
3. RMB drag up (close action)

**Fire Sequence:**
1. LMB (fire)
2. RMB drag up (cycle)
3. RMB drag down (ready)

## Key Findings

### 1. Codebase Ready for Extension
The existing weapon system (`BaseWeapon.cs` → `AssaultRifle.cs`) provides a solid foundation. The `WeaponData` and `CaliberData` resources allow easy configuration of new weapons.

### 2. Multi-Pellet System Not Built-In
The current system spawns one bullet per shot. A shotgun requires spawning 6-12 pellets simultaneously with spread distribution.

### 3. Unique Reload Mechanic
The shell-by-shell reload with mouse drag gestures is a completely new paradigm not present in the current magazine-based system.

### 4. Armory Slot Reserved
The `armory_menu.gd` already has a "Shotgun" slot marked as "Coming soon", indicating planned expansion.

### 5. Real-World Research
- Real 00 buckshot spreads approximately 1 inch per yard (closer to 0.5" with quality ammo)
- Buckshot ricochets occur at shallow angles (typically under 30 degrees)
- Pump-action reload involves distinct open/load/close phases

## Root Causes

1. **Gameplay Variety Need**: Single weapon (M16) limits tactical options
2. **Architecture Gap**: No support for multi-projectile weapons
3. **Input System Gap**: No drag gesture recognition for reload

## Proposed Solutions

### Recommended: Phased Implementation

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Basic shotgun with multi-pellet spread
- Buckshot caliber data
- Large screen shake
- Simple instant reload (temporary)
- Armory integration

**Phase 2 (Enhanced):**
- Pump-action cycling
- RMB up/down gestures for action
- Audio feedback

**Phase 3 (Full):**
- Shell-by-shell manual reload
- MMB loading gesture
- Complete animation support

## Implementation Complexity

| Feature | Complexity | Risk |
|---------|------------|------|
| Multi-pellet spawn | Medium | Low |
| Cone spread | Low | Low |
| Buckshot caliber | Low | Low |
| Large screen shake | Low | Low |
| Semi-auto fire | Low | Low |
| Pump-action cycle | High | Medium |
| Shell reload | High | High |
| Mouse drag gestures | High | High |

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Deliver playable shotgun quickly
2. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Add complexity incrementally
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Don't break M16 functionality
4. **Create Tests**: Shell reload is complex enough to warrant unit tests

## Conclusion

The shotgun implementation is technically feasible and architecturally sound within the existing codebase. The primary challenge lies in the manual shell reload system, which requires a new input paradigm. A phased approach is recommended to balance feature delivery with risk management.
