# Case Study: Issue #369 - Update Enemy Search State with Player Position Prediction

## Issue Summary

**Issue Title:** update состояние поиска врагов (update enemy search state)

**Issue Description (translated from Russian):**
> After one observation cycle, enemies should predict where the player is located and conduct a search around that place (each enemy makes their own prediction).

**Related Issues:**
- Issue #322: Add SEARCHING state for methodical enemy search (CLOSED, merged)
- Issue #330: Enemies never return to IDLE after engaging - search infinitely (CLOSED, merged)
- Issue #334: Enemies in SEARCHING state should look into gaps between walls (OPEN)
- Issue #298: Add ability for AI to predict player actions (OPEN)
- Issue #354: Stuck detection for SEARCHING state (CLOSED, merged)

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. Enemy AI Architecture

The game uses a hybrid AI system combining:

1. **Finite State Machine (FSM)** - Primary state management via `AIState` enum:
   - `IDLE` - Default patrol or guard behavior
   - `COMBAT` - Actively engaging the player
   - `SEEKING_COVER` - Moving to cover position
   - `IN_COVER` - Taking cover from player fire
   - `FLANKING` - Attempting to flank the player
   - `SUPPRESSED` - Under fire, staying in cover
   - `RETREATING` - Retreating while possibly shooting
   - `PURSUING` - Moving cover-to-cover toward player
   - `ASSAULT` - Coordinated multi-enemy assault (disabled)
   - `SEARCHING` - Methodically searching area where player was last seen

2. **Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)** - For tactical decision making:
   - Located in `scripts/ai/goap_planner.gd` and `scripts/ai/goap_action.gd`
   - Actions defined in `scripts/ai/enemy_actions.gd`
   - Uses A* search for optimal action sequences
   - Includes memory-based actions: `InvestigateHighConfidenceAction`, `InvestigateMediumConfidenceAction`, `SearchLowConfidenceAction`

3. **Enemy Memory System** - Tracks player position with confidence:
   - Located in `scripts/ai/enemy_memory.gd`
   - Confidence levels: HIGH (>0.8), MEDIUM (0.5-0.8), LOW (0.3-0.5), LOST (<0.05)
   - Sources: Visual (1.0), Gunshot (0.7), Reload/Empty click (0.6)
   - Intel sharing between enemies with 0.9 confidence degradation factor

### 2. Current SEARCHING State Implementation

The SEARCHING state (Issue #322) implements:

```gdscript
# Search State variables (from enemy.gd lines 425-450)
var _search_center: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO  # Center position for search pattern
var _search_radius: float = 100.0  # Current search radius (expands over time)
const SEARCH_INITIAL_RADIUS: float = 100.0
const SEARCH_RADIUS_EXPANSION: float = 75.0
const SEARCH_MAX_RADIUS: float = 400.0
var _search_waypoints: Array[Vector2] = []  # Waypoints to visit during search
```

**Current Search Pattern:**
- Uses an **expanding square spiral pattern** starting from a fixed center
- Enemies move to waypoints and scan (rotate) at each point
- Zone tracking prevents revisiting same areas
- Expands radius when all waypoints visited
- Maximum 30 seconds search time (unless engaged enemy, then infinite)

**Limitations of Current Implementation:**
1. Search center is fixed (last known position or enemy's current position)
2. Each enemy searches the same area - no individual prediction
3. No consideration of player movement speed/time passed
4. No prediction based on environment (covers, choke points, flank routes)
5. All enemies share the same search pattern

## Problem Statement

The issue requests that enemies should:
1. **Predict** where the player might be after one observation cycle
2. Each enemy should make their **own prediction** (individual, not shared)
3. Conduct search **around the predicted position** rather than the last known position

## Research: Industry Solutions and Patterns

### 1. Occupancy Maps (Third Eye Crime Approach)

**Source:** [Third Eye Crime: Building a Stealth Game Around Occupancy Maps](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIIDE/article/view/12663) by Damián Isla

**How it works:**
- Uses probability diffusion to represent likelihood of player being in each area
- After line-of-sight breaks, probability spreads to nearby locations
- Probability updates when:
  - Enemy looks at area and doesn't see player (set to 0, rescale rest)
  - Time elapses (distribution becomes more diffuse)
  - Player is spotted (accumulate whole probability at that spot)
- Enemies move to highest probability point

**Applicability:** This is the most sophisticated solution but requires significant implementation effort. Could be simplified for this project.

### 2. Probabilistic Hypothesis System (Issue #298 proposal)

The repo already has a proposed system in Issue #298:
```gdscript
var hypotheses = {
    "flank_left": {"pos": Vector2, "probability": 0.3},
    "flank_right": {"pos": Vector2, "probability": 0.3},
    "cover": {"pos": Vector2, "probability": 0.4}
}
```

This aligns well with the current request.

### 3. Last Known Position + Prediction Radius

**Traditional approach:**
- Store last known position
- Calculate maximum distance player could have traveled: `max_distance = PLAYER_SPEED * time_passed`
- Generate prediction points within this radius based on:
  - Nearby cover positions
  - Escape routes
  - Flank positions

### 4. FEAR-Style GOAP Search Behavior

**Source:** [Building the AI of F.E.A.R. with Goal Oriented Action Planning](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/building-the-ai-of-f-e-a-r-with-goal-oriented-action-planning)

F.E.A.R. used GOAP for dynamic planning where:
- Enemies could predict player behavior based on context
- Each enemy independently plans their search route
- Coordination happens through shared world state, not shared plans

### 5. Adaptive Search with Player Behavior Analysis (Metal Gear Solid V)

**Source:** [The Predictable Problem: Why Stealth Game AI Needs an Overhaul](https://www.wayline.io/blog/predictable-problem-stealth-game-ai-overhaul)

- Track player's previous behaviors
- If player frequently flanks, increase probability of checking flanks
- Morale systems affect search aggression

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Simple Position Prediction (Recommended - Low Complexity)

Add individual position prediction to each enemy:

```gdscript
## Predicted player position (each enemy makes their own prediction)
var _predicted_player_position: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO
var _prediction_confidence: float = 0.0

## Prediction factors based on environment analysis
func _generate_position_prediction(last_known_pos: Vector2, time_passed: float) -> Vector2:
    var max_distance = PLAYER_SPEED * time_passed

    # Get nearby cover positions
    var covers = _find_nearby_covers(last_known_pos, max_distance)

    # Get flank positions relative to this enemy
    var my_pos = global_position
    var flank_positions = _get_flank_positions(last_known_pos, my_pos)

    # Weight positions by probability
    var candidates = []

    # Covers get higher weight (player likely to use cover)
    for cover in covers:
        candidates.append({
            "pos": cover,
            "weight": 0.4 + randf() * 0.2  # 0.4-0.6 base weight with variance
        })

    # Add flank positions
    for flank in flank_positions:
        if flank.distance_to(last_known_pos) <= max_distance:
            candidates.append({
                "pos": flank,
                "weight": 0.2 + randf() * 0.2  # 0.2-0.4 weight
            })

    # Add last known position (player might stay)
    candidates.append({
        "pos": last_known_pos,
        "weight": 0.1 + randf() * 0.1
    })

    # Select weighted random position (each enemy gets different result)
    return _weighted_random_select(candidates)
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- Uses existing navigation/cover detection systems
- Each enemy naturally gets different predictions due to randomness and different relative positions

**Cons:**
- No learning from player behavior
- Less sophisticated than occupancy maps

### Solution 2: Probability Hypothesis System (Medium Complexity)

Implement the system proposed in Issue #298:

```gdscript
class_name PlayerHypothesis
extends RefCounted

var hypotheses: Dictionary = {}

func generate_hypotheses(last_known_pos: Vector2, enemy_pos: Vector2, time_passed: float) -> void:
    hypotheses.clear()
    var max_dist = PLAYER_SPEED * time_passed

    # Find nearby covers
    var covers = _find_covers_in_radius(last_known_pos, max_dist)
    var best_cover = _get_best_cover(covers, enemy_pos)
    if best_cover:
        hypotheses["cover"] = {"pos": best_cover, "probability": 0.4}

    # Calculate flank positions
    var left_flank = _calculate_flank(last_known_pos, enemy_pos, -1)
    var right_flank = _calculate_flank(last_known_pos, enemy_pos, 1)

    if _is_reachable(last_known_pos, left_flank, max_dist):
        hypotheses["flank_left"] = {"pos": left_flank, "probability": 0.25}
    if _is_reachable(last_known_pos, right_flank, max_dist):
        hypotheses["flank_right"] = {"pos": right_flank, "probability": 0.25}

    # Stayed in place
    hypotheses["stayed"] = {"pos": last_known_pos, "probability": 0.1}

    # Normalize probabilities
    _normalize_probabilities()

func get_most_probable() -> Dictionary:
    var best = {"pos": Vector2.ZERO, "probability": 0.0}
    for key in hypotheses:
        if hypotheses[key].probability > best.probability:
            best = hypotheses[key]
    return best

func get_random_weighted() -> Dictionary:
    # Returns random hypothesis weighted by probability
    # Ensures each enemy can get different result
    pass
```

**Pros:**
- Structured approach matching Issue #298 proposal
- Extensible for future improvements
- Good balance of complexity and effectiveness

**Cons:**
- Requires new class/file
- More complex than Solution 1

### Solution 3: Simplified Occupancy Map (High Complexity)

Implement a grid-based probability map:

```gdscript
class_name SimpleOccupancyMap
extends RefCounted

var grid_size: float = 50.0
var grid: Dictionary = {}  # key = "x,y", value = probability

func update_from_last_seen(pos: Vector2, confidence: float) -> void:
    _place_probability(pos, confidence)

func diffuse(delta: float, diffusion_rate: float = 0.1) -> void:
    # Spread probability to adjacent cells
    # Decay probability over time
    pass

func update_from_observation(pos: Vector2, can_see: bool) -> void:
    if can_see:
        # Not there - set to 0
        _set_probability(pos, 0.0)
        _renormalize()
    else:
        # Still possible - no change
        pass

func get_highest_probability_position() -> Vector2:
    pass
```

**Pros:**
- Industry-proven technique (Third Eye Crime)
- Most realistic player prediction
- Natural probability decay and diffusion

**Cons:**
- Significant implementation effort
- Memory overhead for grid
- May be overkill for current game scope

## Recommended Implementation

Based on the current codebase architecture and the specific request in Issue #369, I recommend **Solution 1 (Simple Position Prediction)** with elements from **Solution 2 (Hypothesis System)** as a follow-up.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Add prediction variables to enemy.gd:**
   ```gdscript
   var _predicted_search_center: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO
   var _prediction_made: bool = false
   ```

2. **Modify `_transition_to_searching()` to use prediction:**
   - Calculate predicted position before starting search
   - Use predicted position as search center instead of last known position

3. **Add prediction function:**
   - Use time since last visual contact
   - Consider nearby covers
   - Consider flank positions relative to this enemy
   - Add randomness for individual predictions

4. **Update `_generate_search_waypoints()` to start from predicted center:**
   - Already uses `_search_center`, just need to set it to predicted position

### Key Files to Modify:
- `scripts/objects/enemy.gd` - Add prediction logic
- `scripts/ai/enemy_memory.gd` - Add last visual contact timestamp

## Game Log Analysis

### Log File: `game_log_20260125_083304.txt`

A detailed game log was captured during testing on 2026-01-25 08:33:04. The log contains ~7774 lines of enemy AI behavior data.

#### Key Observations from Log Analysis:

1. **Search Expansion Timing Analysis:**
   - Search starts at radius=100, expands to 175, 250, 325, 400
   - Original expansion increment: 75 pixels
   - Time between expansions: approximately 7-8 seconds
   - This was identified as too slow by the user

2. **Multiple Enemies Search Same Area:**
   ```
   [08:33:22] Enemy1 SEARCHING started: center=(607.6915, 643.8395)
   [08:33:22] Enemy2 SEARCHING started: center=(666.3936, 699.4895)
   [08:33:22] Enemy3 SEARCHING started: center=(666.3936, 699.4895) <- Same as Enemy2!
   [08:33:22] Enemy4 SEARCHING started: center=(522.1313, 723.0651)
   ```
   Enemy2 and Enemy3 started searching at the identical center position.

3. **No Prediction Logs Found:**
   - The log contained no prediction-related entries
   - All search centers were based on raw last known positions

4. **Timeline of Search Expansion Events:**
   | Time | Enemy | Radius | Notes |
   |------|-------|--------|-------|
   | 08:33:22 | All | 100 | Initial search start |
   | 08:33:30 | 2,3 | 175 | First expansion (~8s) |
   | 08:33:31 | 1 | 175 | First expansion (~9s) |
   | 08:33:32 | 4 | 175 | First expansion (~10s) |
   | 08:33:38 | 1,2,3 | 250 | Second expansion |
   | 08:33:45 | 4 | 250 | Second expansion |
   | 08:33:49 | 2,3 | 325 | Third expansion |
   | 08:33:54 | 1 | 325 | Third expansion |
   | 08:33:59 | 4 | 325 | Third expansion |
   | 08:34:03 | 2,3 | 400 | Max radius reached |

#### Root Cause Analysis:

1. **Slow Expansion Speed:** The `SEARCH_RADIUS_EXPANSION` constant was set to 75.0 pixels, causing slow area coverage.

2. **No Individual Prediction:** The `_transition_to_searching()` function used the raw `center_position` parameter directly without any prediction logic.

3. **Shared Search Centers:** When multiple enemies lost sight of the player at the same position, they all searched the same area.

---

## Implementation (PR #372)

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Increased Search Zone Expansion Speed

**File:** `scripts/objects/enemy.gd`

```gdscript
# Before:
const SEARCH_RADIUS_EXPANSION: float = 75.0

# After:
const SEARCH_RADIUS_EXPANSION: float = 100.0  # Issue #369: increased from 75
```

This change increases the expansion step from 75 to 100 pixels, resulting in:
- Faster area coverage (approximately 33% faster)
- Fewer expansion cycles needed to reach max radius

#### 2. Added Player Position Prediction System

**New Constants Added:**
```gdscript
## Issue #369: Player position prediction for search state.
const PLAYER_SPEED_ESTIMATE: float = 300.0  ## Estimated player max speed (pixels/sec).
const PREDICTION_COVER_WEIGHT: float = 0.5  ## Weight for cover positions in prediction.
const PREDICTION_FLANK_WEIGHT: float = 0.3  ## Weight for flank positions in prediction.
const PREDICTION_RANDOM_WEIGHT: float = 0.2  ## Weight for random offset in prediction.
const PREDICTION_MIN_PROBABILITY: float = 0.3  ## Minimum probability to use prediction (0.0-1.0).
const PREDICTION_CHECK_DISTANCE: float = 500.0  ## Max distance to check for covers/flanks.
```

**New Functions Added:**

1. `_predict_player_position(last_known_pos: Vector2) -> Vector2`
   - Calculates time elapsed since last seeing player
   - Determines maximum distance player could have traveled
   - Collects weighted prediction candidates (covers, flanks, random)
   - Uses weighted random selection for individual predictions

2. `_find_prediction_covers(center: Vector2, max_distance: float) -> Array[Vector2]`
   - Uses existing cover raycast system
   - Finds navigable cover positions within reachable distance

3. `_get_prediction_flanks(center: Vector2, max_distance: float) -> Array[Vector2]`
   - Calculates left/right flank positions relative to enemy
   - Returns only navigable positions

#### 3. Modified `_transition_to_searching()` Function

The function now calls `_predict_player_position()` before setting the search center:

```gdscript
func _transition_to_searching(center_position: Vector2) -> void:
    # Issue #369: Try to predict player position instead of using raw last known position
    var predicted_center := _predict_player_position(center_position)
    _search_center = predicted_center
    # ... rest of initialization
```

### Prediction Algorithm Details:

1. **30% chance to skip prediction** (`PREDICTION_MIN_PROBABILITY = 0.3`) - ensures variety
2. **If player was seen < 0.5 seconds ago** - use last known position (still accurate)
3. **Calculate max travel distance:** `PLAYER_SPEED_ESTIMATE * time_elapsed`
4. **Weight candidates:**
   - Cover positions: 50% weight (players tend to seek cover)
   - Flank positions: 30% weight (relative to enemy, not shared)
   - Random offset: 20% weight (unpredictable movement)
   - Last known position: 10% weight (fallback)
5. **Weighted random selection** - each enemy rolls differently

### Expected Behavior After Changes:

1. **Faster expansion:** Search radius expands 100px per cycle instead of 75px
2. **Individual predictions:** Each enemy calculates their own predicted search center based on:
   - Their relative position to the last known player location
   - Nearby cover positions
   - Random variance
3. **Logged predictions:** New log entries show when prediction is used:
   ```
   Prediction selected: cover at (x, y) (time_elapsed=2.5s, max_dist=750.0)
   SEARCHING started: center=(x, y), radius=100, waypoints=5 (predicted from (orig_x, orig_y))
   ```

---

## Conclusion

Issue #369 requests a significant improvement to the enemy AI search behavior. The current implementation uses a fixed expanding spiral pattern from the last known position. The requested feature would make enemies more intelligent by:

1. Predicting where the player might have moved
2. Having each enemy make independent predictions
3. Searching around predicted positions rather than just the last known position

**Implementation Status:** Solution 1 (Simple Position Prediction) has been implemented with the following key features:
- Increased search expansion speed (75 → 100 pixels per expansion)
- Individual prediction per enemy based on covers, flanks, and random variance
- Logging for debugging prediction selections
- 30% base probability to use prediction (configurable via `PREDICTION_MIN_PROBABILITY`)

This can later be enhanced with the full hypothesis system (Solution 2) as described in Issue #298.
