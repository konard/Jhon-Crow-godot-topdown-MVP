# Game Log - User Report 2026-01-18
# Shows enemy state cycling issue: COMBAT → SEEKING_COVER → IN_COVER loop

# Summary from user:
# Enemies just stand in cover and reset COMBAT counter in a loop.
# They should exit to line of direct contact with player and then shoot.

# Key observations from log analysis:
# - Enemies repeatedly cycle through COMBAT → SEEKING_COVER → IN_COVER
# - Enemy3 and Enemy10 show tactical behavior with FLANKING and PURSUING attempts
# - But they keep returning to cover without successfully shooting
