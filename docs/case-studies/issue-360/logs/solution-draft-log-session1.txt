" --append-system-prompt "You are an AI issue solver. You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.
General guidelines.
   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.
   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.
   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.
   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:
      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-360-6b008a412327 --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha
      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA
      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log
      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures
      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs
      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.
      Note: If user says \"failing\" but tools show \"passing\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.
   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.
   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.
   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.
   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.
   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.
   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.

Initial research.
   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.
   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.
   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.
   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \"Could not process image\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \"HTML\" or \"text\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.
   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/360.
   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].
   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.
   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.
   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.
   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.
   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.
   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.
   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:
      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/361/comments --paginate
      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/361/comments --paginate
      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/361/reviews --paginate
      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!
   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/360/comments --paginate.

Solution development and testing.
   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.
   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.
   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.
   - When you test:
      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;
      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.
   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.
   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.
   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.
   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.
   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 361 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.

Preparing pull request.
   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.
   - When you commit, write clear message.
   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].
   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.
   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.
   - When you update existing pr 361, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.
   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.
   - When you finalize the pull request:
      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,
      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,
      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,
      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,
      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,
      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,
      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,
      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.
   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 361.

Workflow and collaboration.
   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.
   - When you push, push only to branch issue-360-6b008a412327.
   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-360-6b008a412327. (Note: PR 361 already exists, update it instead)
   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).
   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.
   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.
   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.
   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-360-6b008a412327.
   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.
   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 361 already exists for this branch.

Self review.
   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.
   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.
   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].
   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.

GitHub CLI command patterns.
   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).
   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.
   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\${owner}/\${repo}/pulls/\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.

Playwright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).
   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.
   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.
   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.
   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.
   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).
   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.
   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources." | jq -c .)

[2026-01-25T05:55:02.439Z] [INFO] You are an AI issue solver. You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.
General guidelines.
   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.
   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.
   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.
   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:
      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-360-6b008a412327 --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha
      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA
      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log
      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures
      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs
      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.
      Note: If user says "failing" but tools show "passing", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.
   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.
   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.
   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.
   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.
   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.
   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.

Initial research.
   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.
   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.
   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.
   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause "Could not process image" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows "HTML" or "text", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.
   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/360.
   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].
   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.
   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.
   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.
   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.
   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.
   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.
   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:
      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/361/comments --paginate
      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/361/comments --paginate
      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/361/reviews --paginate
      IMPORTANT: The command "gh pr view --json comments" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!
   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/360/comments --paginate.

Solution development and testing.
   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.
   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.
   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.
   - When you test:
      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;
      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.
   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.
   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.
   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.
   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.
   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 361 --body "your message" to comment on existing PR.

   - When you commit, write clear message.

C# Player не имел BloodyFeetComponent\\n\\nВ логе были записи об инициализации BloodyFeetComponent для всех врагов:\\n```\\n[BloodyFeet:Enemy1] BloodyFeetComponent ready on Enemy1\\n[BloodyFeet:Enemy2] BloodyFeetComponent ready on Enemy2\\n...\\n```\\n\\nНо **не было** записей для Player. Причина: `BuildingLevel.tscn` использует `scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn` (C# версия), но компонент был добавлен только в `scenes/characters/Player.tscn` (GDScript версия).\\n\\n**Исправление:** Добавил BloodyFeetComponent в C# версию Player.tscn.\\n\\n### 2. Детектор крови не следовал за персонажем\\n\\nArea2D для обнаружения луж крови был добавлен как дочерний элемент Node (BloodyFeetComponent), а не CharacterBody2D. В Godot, обычный Node не имеет трансформации - поэтому детектор оставался на позиции (0, 0) в мировых координатах вместо того, чтобы следовать за игроком.\\n\\n**Исправление:** Изменил `_setup_blood_detector()` чтобы добавлять Area2D к родительскому CharacterBody2D:\\n```gdscript\\n# Было (баг):\\nadd_child(_blood_detector)\\n\\n# Стало (исправлено):\\n_parent_body.add_child(_blood_detector)\\n```\\n\\n### Добавлено отладочное логирование\\n\\nВключил `debug_logging = true` в сценах, чтобы было проще тестировать. В логах теперь будут появляться:\\n- Сообщения о создании луж крови\\n- Периодические проверки перекрытий (каждые ~2 секунды)\\n- Сообщения о шагах в кровь и создании следов\\n\\nПожалуйста, протестируйте ещё раз!\",\"author_association\":\"CONTRIBUTOR\",\"reactions\":{\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3795819448/reactions\",\"total_count\":0,\"+1\":0,\"-1\":0,\"laugh\":0,\"hooray\":0,\"confused\":0,\"heart\":0,\"rocket\":0,\"eyes\":0},\"performed_via_github_app\":null},{\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3795819665\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/361#issuecomment-3795819665\",\"issue_url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/361\",\"id\":3795819665,\"node_id\":\"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87iP5yR\",\"user\":{\"login\":\"konard\",\"id\":1431904,\"node_id\":\"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=\",\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4\",\"gravatar_id\":\"\",\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/konard\",\"followers_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers\",\"following_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}\",\"gists_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}\",\"starred_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}\",\"subscriptions_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions\",\"organizations_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs\",\"repos_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos\",\"events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}\",\"received_events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events\",\"type\":\"User\",\"user_view_type\":\"public\",\"site_admin\":false},\"created_at\":\"2026-01-25T01:52:00Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2026-01-25T01:52:00Z\",\"body\":\"##

You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.\\nGeneral guidelines.\\n   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.\\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.\\n   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:\\n      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-360-6b008a412327 --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha\\n      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA\\n      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log\\n      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures\\n      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs\\n      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.\\n      Note: If user says \\\\\\\"failing\\\\\\\" but tools show \\\\\\\"passing\\\\\\\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.\\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.\\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.\\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\\n\\nInitial research.\\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\\n   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.\\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \\\\\\\"Could not process image\\\\\\\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \\\\\\\"HTML\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.\\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/360.\\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].\\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.\\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\\n   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:\\n      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/361/comments --paginate\\n      2.

(Note: PR 361 already exists, update it instead)\\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-360-6b008a412327.\\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 361 already exists for this branch.\\n\\nSelf review.\\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\\n\\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\\\\${owner}/\\\\${repo}/pulls/\\\\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\\n\\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\\\" | jq -c .)\\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.610Z] [INFO] \\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.610Z] [INFO] 📋 User prompt:\\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.610Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN USER PROMPT---\\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.610Z] [INFO] Issue to solve: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/360\\nYour prepared branch: issue-360-6b008a412327\\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769309925878\\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/361\\nYour forked repository: konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\\nOriginal repository (upstream): Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP\\nGitHub Actions on your fork: https://github.com/konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP/actions?query=branch%3Aissue-360-6b008a412327\\n\\nNew comments on the pull request: 3\\nPull request description was edited after last commit\\n\\nContinue.\\n\\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.610Z] [INFO] ---END USER PROMPT---\\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.610Z] [INFO] \\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.610Z] [INFO] 📋 System prompt:\\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.611Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN SYSTEM PROMPT---\\n[2026-01-25T02:59:04.611Z] [INFO] You are an AI issue solver.

Timing - Area2D может не успевать обрабатываться физическим сервером\\n2. Collision layers могут не совпадать в рантайме\\n3.

Изменён `z_index` с `-1` на `1` (следы теперь отрисовываются поверх пола)\\n2. Увеличен размер текстуры следов (16x24 вместо 12x18 пикселей)\\n3. Увеличена яркость красного цвета (0.6 вместо 0.5)\\n4. Увеличен масштаб следов (`footprint_scale`: 0.8 → 1.0)\\n\\n### 📁 Файлы изменены / Files Changed\\n\\n- `scenes/effects/BloodFootprint.tscn` - z_index, размер, цвет\\n- `scripts/effects/blood_footprint.gd` - z_index в _ready()\\n- `scripts/components/bloody_feet_component.gd` - z_index при создании, масштаб\\n\\nПожалуйста, протестируйте снова!

When the player or an enemy steps into a blood puddle, bloody boot footprints appear behind them, becoming more transparent with each step until they disappear.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Blood puddle detection**: Characters detect when they step in blood via Area2D overlap\n- **Fading footprints**: Each consecutive footprint is more transparent than the previous\n- **Persistent decals**: Footprints do NOT fade over time (as per requirements)\n- **Unlimited count**: No maximum limit on footprints (as per requirements)\n- **Both characters**: Feature applies to both player and enemies\n- **Alternating feet**: Left/right foot alternation for realistic trail\n- **Facing direction rotation**: Footprints rotate based on character's facing direction (aim direction)\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- New `BloodyFeetComponent` component attached to Player and Enemy scenes\n- New `BloodFootprint.tscn` scene for footprint decals\n- Updated `BloodDecal` script to add Area2D collision for puddle detection\n- Added unit tests for `BloodyFeetComponent`\n\n### Configuration (BloodyFeetComponent)\n| Property | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| `blood_steps_count` | 6 | Number of footprints before blood runs out |\n| `step_distance` | 30.0 | Pixels between footprint spawns |\n| `initial_alpha` | 0.8 | Alpha of first footprint |\n| `alpha_decay_rate` | 0.12 | Alpha reduction per step |\n| `footprint_scale` | 0.8 | Size multiplier for footprints |\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n#### Session 1 (2026-01-25)\n\n1. **C# Player Scene Missing Component**: The `BloodyFeetComponent` was only added to the GDScript Player scene, but `BuildingLevel.tscn` uses the C# Player scene (`scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn`). Added the component to the C# scene.\n\n2. **Blood Detector Not Following Character**: The Area2D blood detector was parented to the `BloodyFeetComponent` Node (which has no transform), causing it to stay at world position (0, 0) instead of following the character. Fixed by parenting the detector to the CharacterBody2D.\n\n#### Session 2 (2026-01-25)\n\n3. **Texture Cropping Issue**: Boot print textures (11x16 px) were being cropped at top/bottom when rotated. Added vertical padding by increasing texture height to 20px (11x20).\n\n4. **Footprint Rotation Direction**: Footprints were rotating based on movement direction instead of character facing direction. Now uses `PlayerModel` or `EnemyModel` global_rotation to match the direction the character is looking/aiming. Handles flipped sprites correctly (when aiming left, scale.y is negative).\n\n### Debug Logging\n- Enabled `debug_logging = true` in scene files for testing\n- Added logging to `blood_decal.gd` for tracing puddle creation\n- Added periodic overlap check logging to `BloodyFeetComponent`\n\n### Files Changed\n- `scripts/components/bloody_feet_component.gd` - Main component (facing direction rotation)\n- `scripts/effects/blood_footprint.gd` - Footprint decal script\n- `scenes/effects/BloodFootprint.tscn` - Footprint scene\n- `scripts/effects/blood_decal.gd` - Added puddle detection Area2D + logging\n- `scenes/characters/Player.tscn` - Added BloodyFeetComponent (GDScript version)\n- `scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn` - Added BloodyFeetComponent (C# version)\n- `scenes/objects/Enemy.tscn` - Added BloodyFeetComponent\n- `assets/sprites/effects/boot_print_*.png` - Boot print textures (11x20 with padding)\n- `tests/unit/test_bloody_feet_component.gd` - Unit tests\n- `docs/case-studies/issue-360/` - Case study with debugging analysis and game logs\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [ ] Player stepping in blood puddle triggers footprint spawning\n- [ ] Footprints fade in alpha with each step (not over time)\n- [ ] Footprints stop appearing after `blood_steps_count` steps\n- [ ] Stepping in blood again resets the footprint counter\n- [ ] Enemies also leave bloody footprints\n- [ ] Footprints rotate to match character facing direction (not movement)\n- [ ] Texture not cropped at top/bottom when rotated\n- [ ] No performance issues with many footprints\n- [ ] Unit tests pass\n\nFixes #360\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)",

Based on the owner's feedback:\n\n1. **Rotate 90 degrees clockwise** - The boot print texture currently faces \"up\" (toe at top). After rotating 90° clockwise, the toe would point \"right\". But since the rotation is applied in code based on facing direction, I need to add a 90° offset in the code.\n\n2. **10% smaller** - Current scale is 0.8 in scenes, should be 0.72 (0.8 * 0.9)\n\n3. **Texture 2x size with transparent padding** - Currently 11x20, should be 22x40 with the boot print centered\n\n4. **Only on floor without blood** - Need to check if the spawn position is NOT on a blood puddle\n\nLet me update my todo list and start implementing the fixes:"

When the player or an enemy steps into a blood puddle, bloody boot footprints appear behind them, becoming more transparent with each step until they disappear.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Blood puddle detection**: Characters detect when they step in blood via Area2D overlap\n- **Fading footprints**: Each consecutive footprint is more transparent than the previous\n- **Persistent decals**: Footprints do NOT fade over time (as per requirements)\n- **Unlimited count**: No maximum limit on footprints (as per requirements)\n- **Both characters**: Feature applies to both player and enemies\n- **Alternating feet**: Left/right foot alternation for realistic trail\n- **Facing direction rotation**: Footprints rotate based on character's facing direction (aim direction)\n- **No footprints on blood**: Footprints only spawn on floor without blood\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- New `BloodyFeetComponent` component attached to Player and Enemy scenes\n- New `BloodFootprint.tscn` scene for footprint decals\n- Updated `BloodDecal` script to add Area2D collision for puddle detection\n- Added unit tests for `BloodyFeetComponent`\n\n### Configuration (BloodyFeetComponent)\n| Property | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| `blood_steps_count` | 6 | Number of footprints before blood runs out |\n| `step_distance` | 30.0 | Pixels between footprint spawns |\n| `initial_alpha` | 0.8 | Alpha of first footprint |\n| `alpha_decay_rate` | 0.12 | Alpha reduction per step |\n| `footprint_scale` | 0.72 | Size multiplier for footprints |\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n#### Session 1 (2026-01-25)\n\n1. **C# Player Scene Missing Component**: The `BloodyFeetComponent` was only added to the GDScript Player scene, but `BuildingLevel.tscn` uses the C# Player scene (`scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn`). Added the component to the C# scene.\n\n2. **Blood Detector Not Following Character**: The Area2D blood detector was parented to the `BloodyFeetComponent` Node (which has no transform), causing it to stay at world position (0, 0) instead of following the character. Fixed by parenting the detector to the CharacterBody2D.\n\n#### Session 2 (2026-01-25)\n\n3. **Texture Cropping Issue**: Boot print textures (11x16 px) were being cropped at top/bottom when rotated. Added vertical padding by increasing texture height to 20px (11x20).\n\n4. **Footprint Rotation Direction**: Footprints were rotating based on movement direction instead of character facing direction. Now uses `PlayerModel` or `EnemyModel` global_rotation to match the direction the character is looking/aiming. Handles flipped sprites correctly (when aiming left, scale.y is negative).\n\n#### Session 3 (2026-01-25)\n\n5. **Footprint Rotation 90° Off**: Boot prints were oriented incorrectly relative to the character's facing direction. Added PI/2 (90 degrees clockwise) offset to the rotation calculation.\n\n6. **Footprints Too Large**: Reduced `footprint_scale` from 0.8 to 0.72 (10% smaller as requested).\n\n7. **Texture Still Being Cropped**: Expanded boot print texture canvas from 11x20 to 22x40 (2x original size) with transparent padding to prevent cropping during rotation.\n\n8. **Footprints Appearing on Blood**: Added `_is_on_blood_puddle()` check to prevent footprints from spawning when character is currently standing on a blood puddle. Footprints now only appear on floor without blood.\n\n### Debug Logging\n- Enabled `debug_logging = true` in scene files for testing\n- Added logging to `blood_decal.gd` for tracing puddle creation\n- Added periodic overlap check logging to `BloodyFeetComponent`\n\n### Files Changed\n- `scripts/components/bloody_feet_component.gd` - Main component (facing direction rotation, blood overlap check)\n- `scripts/effects/blood_footprint.gd` - Footprint decal script\n- `scenes/effects/BloodFootprint.tscn` - Footprint scene\n- `scripts/effects/blood_decal.gd` - Added puddle detection Area2D + logging\n- `scenes/characters/Player.tscn` - Added BloodyFeetComponent (GDScript version)\n- `scenes/characters/csharp/Player.tscn` - Added BloodyFeetComponent (C# version)\n- `scenes/objects/Enemy.tscn` - Added BloodyFeetComponent\n- `assets/sprites/effects/boot_print_*.png` - Boot print textures (22x40 with 2x padding)\n- `tests/unit/test_bloody_feet_component.gd` - Unit tests\n- `docs/case-studies/issue-360/` - Case study with debugging analysis and game logs\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [ ] Player stepping in blood puddle triggers footprint spawning\n- [ ] Footprints fade in alpha with each step (not over time)\n- [ ] Footprints stop appearing after `blood_steps_count` steps\n- [ ] Stepping in blood again resets the footprint counter\n- [ ] Enemies also leave bloody footprints\n- [ ] Footprints rotate to match character facing direction (not movement)\n- [ ] Footprints rotated correctly (toe pointing in facing direction)\n- [ ] Texture not cropped at top/bottom when rotated\n- [ ] Footprints only appear on floor without blood\n- [ ] No performance issues with many footprints\n- [ ] Unit tests pass\n\nFixes #360\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\nEOF\n)\" 2>&1",

Поворот следов на 90° по часовой стрелке\n- Добавлен офсет `PI/2` к повороту следов в `_spawn_footprint()`\n- Теперь следы правильно ориентированы по направлению взгляда персонажа\n\n### 2. Уменьшение размера на 10%\n- Изменён `footprint_scale` с 0.8 на 0.72 во всех сценах (Player, C# Player, Enemy)\n\n### 3. Текстура в прозрачном прямоугольнике 2x размера\n- Текстуры boot_print_left.png и boot_print_right.png увеличены с 11x20 до 22x40 пикселей\n- Оригинальный отпечаток центрирован с прозрачными полями вокруг\n- Это предотвращает обрезание текстуры при повороте\n\n### 4. Следы только на полу без крови\n- Добавлена функция `_is_on_blood_puddle()` для проверки\n- В `_spawn_footprint()` добавлена проверка - если персонаж стоит на луже крови, след не создаётся\n- Использует как Area2D overlap detection, так и fallback по дистанции\n\n### 📎 Коммит\n`261810a` - fix: footprint rotation, size, texture padding, and blood overlap\n\n### 📁 Логи\nЗагружены логи из тестирования в `docs/case-studies/issue-360/logs/`\n\nПрошу проверить изменения.\nEOF\n)\" 2>&1",
