# Case Study: Issue #287 - Offensive Grenade Passing Through Walls

## Issue Summary

**Title:** fix наступательная граната проходит сквозь стену (fix offensive grenade passing through wall)

**Problem:** The offensive grenade (FragGrenade) passes through walls when thrown at close range ("в упор" = at point-blank range). The grenade should collide with and explode on walls, but instead it tunnels through them at high velocities.

**Reported Date:** 2026-01-24

## Evidence

### Log Files Analysis

One game log file was provided demonstrating the gameplay session:

1. `game_log_20260124_004642.txt` (4,594 lines total, 585 grenade-related entries)

### Key Observations from Logs

From the log analysis, we found that:

1. **High-velocity throws are common**: Grenades reach maximum speed of ~1186.5 px/s
   ```
   [00:47:09] [INFO] [GrenadeBase] Velocity-based throw! Mouse vel: (3253.838, -1487.863), Swing: 520.7, Transfer: 1.00, Final speed: 1186.5
   ```

2. **Most wall collisions work correctly**:
   ```
   [00:47:17] [INFO] [GrenadeBase] Collision detected with Room2_WallRight (type: StaticBody2D)
   [00:47:17] [INFO] [FragGrenade] Impact detected! Body: Room2_WallRight (type: StaticBody2D), triggering explosion
   ```

3. **Enemy collisions also work**:
   ```
   [00:47:20] [INFO] [GrenadeBase] Collision detected with Enemy3 (type: CharacterBody2D)
   [00:47:20] [INFO] [FragGrenade] Impact detected! Body: Enemy3 (type: CharacterBody2D), triggering explosion
   ```

4. **The issue is intermittent**: The bug occurs when throwing grenades at close range with high velocity, causing the grenade to "tunnel" through thin walls before the physics engine can detect the collision.

### Timeline of Events (Typical Grenade Throw)

1. **T+0.0s**: Player initiates grenade throw (G key + RMB)
2. **T+0.0s**: Grenade created at player position (frozen state)
3. **T+0.0s**: Pin pulled, timer activated (infinite for frag grenades)
4. **T+0.5s**: Player releases RMB, throw velocity calculated
5. **T+0.5s**: Grenade unfrozen, physics enabled, velocity applied
6. **T+0.5s**: Grenade travels at up to 1186.5 px/s
7. **T+0.5s+**: Physics engine checks for collisions **per frame**
8. **Issue**: At 60 FPS, grenade moves ~19.8 pixels per frame at max speed
9. **Issue**: If wall thickness < 19.8px AND grenade position jumps past wall in one frame → tunneling occurs
10. **Normal case**: Collision detected, explosion triggered
11. **Bug case**: No collision detected, grenade passes through wall

## Root Cause Analysis

### Code Location

**Files involved:**
- `scripts/projectiles/grenade_base.gd` - Base grenade physics
- `scripts/projectiles/frag_grenade.gd` - Frag grenade collision handling
- `scenes/projectiles/FragGrenade.tscn` - Grenade scene configuration

### Physics Configuration

From `scenes/projectiles/FragGrenade.tscn`:
```gdscript
[node name="FragGrenade" type="RigidBody2D"]
collision_layer = 32
collision_mask = 6
gravity_scale = 0.0
linear_damp = 2.0
max_throw_speed = 1130.0
# NO continuous_cd property set!
```

From `scripts/projectiles/grenade_base.gd:95-118`:
```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
    # Set up collision
    collision_layer = 32  # Layer 6 (custom for grenades)
    collision_mask = 4 | 2  # obstacles + enemies

    # Enable contact monitoring
    contact_monitor = true
    max_contacts_reported = 4

    # Set up physics
    gravity_scale = 0.0  # Top-down, no gravity
    linear_damp = 1.0

    # Set up physics material for wall bouncing
    var physics_material := PhysicsMaterial.new()
    physics_material.bounce = wall_bounce
    physics_material.friction = 0.3
    physics_material_override = physics_material

    # Start frozen to prevent physics interference
    freeze = true
    freeze_mode = RigidBody2D.FREEZE_MODE_KINEMATIC
```

**Missing Configuration:** No CCD (Continuous Collision Detection) enabled!

### Root Cause: Physics Tunneling

**The fundamental problem is "tunneling"** - a common physics engine issue where fast-moving objects pass through thin obstacles.

#### How Tunneling Occurs:

1. **Discrete Collision Detection** (default in Godot):
   - Physics engine checks collisions once per physics frame (typically 60 FPS)
   - Object position is updated in discrete steps
   - If object moves faster than obstacle thickness in one frame, it can "jump over" the obstacle

2. **Grenade Velocity Analysis**:
   - Maximum grenade speed: **1186.5 px/s**
   - At 60 FPS: **1186.5 / 60 = 19.8 pixels per frame**
   - If wall thickness < 19.8 pixels, grenade can tunnel through in one frame

3. **Close-Range Throwing**:
   - User throws grenade "в упор" (at close range/point-blank)
   - Grenade reaches maximum velocity very quickly
   - Short distance to wall means fewer frames for collision detection
   - Higher probability of tunneling through thin walls

### Why Most Collisions Still Work

- **Thick walls** (>20px) are reliably detected
- **Slower throws** have more time for collision detection
- **Longer distances** give more physics frames to detect collision
- **The bug is intermittent** - only occurs under specific conditions:
  1. High velocity (close to max speed)
  2. Close range to wall
  3. Thin wall (<20px)
  4. Grenade trajectory perpendicular to wall

## Real-World Research

### Physics Tunneling in Game Engines

Tunneling (also called "pass-through" or "bullet-through-paper") is a well-known problem in game physics:

**Sources:**
- [Tunneling | Glossary | GDQuest](https://school.gdquest.com/glossary/tunneling)
  > "Tunneling is when physics entities move fast enough that they jump through walls or collision areas. It's a common problem in game development."

- [High speed physics2d collision - intermittent tunneling · Issue #6664 · godotengine/godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6664)
  > "2D Rigid body passes through kinematic & static body when moving at high speeds (velocity around 800,1000)."

### Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)

CCD is the standard solution for fast-moving objects:

**From GDQuest:**
> "Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) is a physics technique that prevents fast-moving objects from passing through (or 'tunneling through') thin obstacles by checking for collisions along an object's entire movement path."

**Godot Implementation:**
- Property: `continuous_cd` on RigidBody2D
- Two modes:
  1. **CCD_MODE_DISABLED** (default) - No CCD
  2. **CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY** - Ray-based detection (recommended, works reliably)
  3. **CCD_MODE_CAST_SHAPE** - Shape-based detection (more precise but has known bugs)

**Sources:**
- [Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) | Glossary | GDQuest](https://school.gdquest.com/glossary/continuous_collision_detection)
- [Godot rigidbody2d CCD - Godot Forums](https://godotforums.org/d/32349-godot-rigidbody2d-ccd)
- [RigidBody2D continuous collision detection non-functional under Cast Shape setting · Issue #72674 · godotengine/godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/72674)

### Alternative Solutions

**Raycasting Approach:**
> "It's common to use ray-casts or shape-casts to detect collisions for fast-moving objects, which do not have the tunneling problem as they check for collisions along a projected line."

However, CCD is the standard approach for RigidBody2D and is simpler to implement.

## Related Issues and PRs

### Recent Grenade Work

1. **PR #284** (merged 2026-01-23): "Fix offensive grenade not exploding on enemy hit"
   - Issue #283: Grenades weren't detecting CharacterBody2D collisions
   - Solution: Added CharacterBody2D to collision type check

2. **PR #280** (merged 2026-01-23): "Fix offensive grenade (frag grenade) wall impact detection"
   - Issue #279: Wall impacts not detected at all
   - Root cause: Missing `contact_monitor = true`
   - Solution: Enabled contact monitoring in grenade_base.gd

3. **PR #260** (merged 2026-01-23): "Implement realistic velocity-based grenade throwing physics"
   - Introduced velocity-based throwing system
   - Max throw speed: ~1186.5 px/s
   - This PR may have increased the likelihood of tunneling by allowing higher velocities

### Why This Issue Wasn't Caught Earlier

- Tunneling is **intermittent** - only occurs under specific conditions
- Most testing uses longer throw distances where tunneling is less likely
- Thick walls (common in level design) rarely trigger tunneling
- Issue only manifests with close-range, high-velocity throws

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Enable CCD on FragGrenade (Recommended)

**Approach:** Enable Continuous Collision Detection using CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY.

**Implementation:**

1. **In `scenes/projectiles/FragGrenade.tscn`:**
   ```gdscript
   [node name="FragGrenade" type="RigidBody2D"]
   collision_layer = 32
   collision_mask = 6
   continuous_cd = 1  # CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY
   # ... rest of properties
   ```

2. **In `scripts/projectiles/grenade_base.gd` _ready():**
   ```gdscript
   # Enable CCD for fast-moving grenades to prevent tunneling
   continuous_cd = RigidBody2D.CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY
   ```

**Pros:**
- Standard solution for fast-moving physics objects
- Minimal code changes
- Works reliably with CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY
- Fixes tunneling for all wall thicknesses
- No gameplay changes needed

**Cons:**
- Slight performance cost (minimal for small number of grenades)
- CCD_MODE_CAST_SHAPE has known bugs (but we use CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY)

**Why CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY:**
- More reliable than CCD_MODE_CAST_SHAPE
- Sufficient precision for grenade collisions
- Recommended by community for Godot 4.x

### Solution 2: Reduce Maximum Grenade Velocity

**Approach:** Lower max_throw_speed to ensure grenade can't move >10px per frame.

**Implementation:**
```gdscript
max_throw_speed = 600.0  # Was 1130.0
# At 60 FPS: 600 / 60 = 10px per frame
```

**Pros:**
- No CCD needed
- Guaranteed to work

**Cons:**
- Changes game feel significantly
- Reduces grenade throw distance
- Affects gameplay balance
- Doesn't solve the root cause

### Solution 3: Use Raycasting for High-Velocity Detection

**Approach:** Cast a ray from previous position to current position each frame.

**Implementation:** Add raycasting in `_physics_process()` to detect missed collisions.

**Pros:**
- Very precise collision detection
- Custom control over detection

**Cons:**
- Complex implementation
- Requires tracking previous position
- More code to maintain
- Duplicate collision logic

### Solution 4: Increase Wall Thickness

**Approach:** Ensure all walls are >20px thick.

**Pros:**
- No code changes

**Cons:**
- Doesn't solve root cause
- Limits level design
- Not scalable
- Still possible to tunnel with higher velocities

## Recommendation

**Use Solution 1: Enable CCD with CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY**

This is the standard, recommended approach because:

1. **Industry Standard**: CCD is the established solution for fast-moving objects
2. **Minimal Changes**: One-line code change
3. **Reliable**: CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY works consistently in Godot 4.x
4. **Future-Proof**: Protects against tunneling even if velocities increase
5. **No Gameplay Impact**: Maintains current game feel and balance
6. **Performance**: Negligible impact for 1-3 grenades in flight

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add CCD to FragGrenade.tscn**
2. **Add CCD to FlashbangGrenade.tscn** (for consistency)
3. **Update grenade_base.gd** to set CCD in code (belt-and-suspenders)
4. **Test with high-velocity close-range throws**
5. **Verify no collision issues with enemies or other objects**
6. **Document the change in case study**

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing

1. **Close-Range Wall Throws** (reproduce original bug):
   - Stand next to thin wall (~10px)
   - Throw grenade directly at wall with maximum velocity
   - Verify: Grenade explodes on wall, doesn't pass through

2. **Various Wall Thicknesses**:
   - Test walls of 5px, 10px, 15px, 20px thickness
   - Throw grenades at all thicknesses
   - Verify: All collisions detected

3. **Different Velocities**:
   - Slow throw (low velocity)
   - Medium throw (mid velocity)
   - Fast throw (max velocity)
   - Verify: All work correctly

4. **Enemy Collisions**:
   - Throw grenades at enemies
   - Verify: Still explode on enemy hit (no regression)

5. **Ground Landing**:
   - Throw grenades to land on ground
   - Verify: Still explode on landing (no regression)

### Automated Testing

Update `tests/unit/test_frag_grenade.gd`:

```gdscript
func test_ccd_enabled():
    var grenade = preload("res://scenes/projectiles/FragGrenade.tscn").instantiate()
    assert_equal(grenade.continuous_cd, RigidBody2D.CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY,
                 "FragGrenade should have CCD enabled")

func test_no_tunneling_at_max_speed():
    # Create grenade at high velocity near wall
    # Verify collision is detected
    pass  # Requires integration test setup
```

### Performance Testing

- Monitor FPS with multiple grenades in flight
- Verify no performance degradation
- Target: <1% FPS impact

## Technical Notes

### CCD Implementation Details

From Godot documentation:
- `continuous_cd = 0`: CCD_MODE_DISABLED (default)
- `continuous_cd = 1`: CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY (recommended)
- `continuous_cd = 2`: CCD_MODE_CAST_SHAPE (has bugs in Godot 4.x)

### Why Set in Both Scene and Code

1. **Scene file**: Visual confirmation in editor
2. **Code**: Belt-and-suspenders, ensures it's set even if scene changes

### Collision Mask Reminder

Current configuration (correct, don't change):
- `collision_layer = 32` (layer 6 - grenades)
- `collision_mask = 6` (layers 2,3 - obstacles + enemies)
- Does NOT collide with player (layer 1) during throw

## Lessons Learned

1. **High-velocity physics objects need CCD** - Always enable CCD for projectiles >600 px/s
2. **Intermittent bugs are harder to catch** - Need specific testing scenarios
3. **Physics engines have limitations** - Discrete collision detection can miss fast objects
4. **Test edge cases** - Close-range, high-velocity scenarios often reveal issues
5. **Research similar issues** - Godot community has extensive knowledge base

## Conclusion

Issue #287 is caused by **physics tunneling** - fast-moving grenades pass through thin walls when the discrete collision detection system misses the collision between physics frames. The solution is to enable **Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)** using the reliable `CCD_MODE_CAST_RAY` mode, which is the industry-standard approach for fast-moving objects in game engines.

This fix requires minimal code changes, has negligible performance impact, and completely eliminates tunneling issues regardless of wall thickness or grenade velocity.
