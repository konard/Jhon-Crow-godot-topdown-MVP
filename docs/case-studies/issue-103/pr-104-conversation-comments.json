This indicated a critical issue with the SEARCHING state implementation.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe change from `_transition_to_pursuing()` to `_transition_to_searching()` when the player escapes view likely caused an issue with the exported build. The exact cause is difficult to determine without being able to run the exported build, but potential factors include:\n- Physics raycast timing in `_generate_inspection_points()`\n- State transition edge cases\n- Export-specific behavior differences\n\n### Fix Applied\n\nReverted the combat state transition back to PURSUING (original behavior):\n\n```gdscript\n# In _process_combat_state():\nif not _can_see_player:\n    _transition_to_pursuing()  # Restored original behavior\n    return\n```\n\nThe SEARCHING state code remains in the codebase but is disabled with a comment explaining why. This allows for future testing and activation once the issues are resolved.\n\n### What's Preserved\n\n- All SEARCHING state logic remains in the code\n- SearchAreaAction and InspectHidingSpotAction in enemy_actions.gd\n- Debug visualization for the search zone\n- Case study documentation with regression analysis\n\n### Testing\n\nCI checks are passing:\n- ✅ Build Windows Portable EXE\n- ✅ Run GUT Tests\n\nPlease test the exported build to verify the fix resolves the regression.\n\n---\n\n📁 Log files saved to: `docs/case-studies/issue-103/logs/`\n📄 Full regression analysis: `docs/case-studies/issue-103/README.md`","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764848070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764848361","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/104#issuecomment-3764848361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/104","id":3764848361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87gZwbp","user":{"login":"konard","id":1431904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard","html_url":"https://github.com/konard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-18T03:14:13Z","updated_at":"2026-01-18T03:14:13Z","body":"## 🤖 Solution Draft Log\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\n\n💰 **Cost estimation:**\n- Public pricing estimate: $6.882263 USD\n- Calculated by Anthropic: $4.575322 USD\n- Difference: $-2.306941 (-33.52%)\n📎 **Log file uploaded as Gist** (837KB)\n🔗 [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/konard/e3a6788b3da2976694a0e3e57ab4c121/raw/dcc5e4f67a2cc6a2a2018d9f13be617a60c5c2f9/solution-draft-log-pr-1768706048708.txt)\n---\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764848361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764851352","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/104#issuecomment-3764851352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/104","id":3764851352,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87gZxKY","user":{"login":"Jhon-Crow","id":133867474,"node_id":"U_kgDOB_qn0g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133867474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-18T03:18:56Z","updated_at":"2026-01-18T03:18:56Z","body":"нет, всё ещё враги просто стоят на месте и никакой интерактивности.\r\n[game_log_20260118_061726.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24693360/game_log_20260118_061726.txt)\r\nдебаг так же не работает","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764851352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
