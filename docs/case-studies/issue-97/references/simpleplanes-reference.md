## Relevance to Issue #97

This reference was provided by the issue author as an example of the type of assault rifle visual desired. Key takeaways:

1. **M16-inspired design** - The Groza design incorporates M16 elements
2. **Detailed modeling** - High part count suggests attention to detail
3. **Functional emphasis** - Working action and sights important
4. **Military aesthetic** - Combines multiple real-world rifle designs

## Adaptation Notes

For the Godot 2D top-down project:
- 3D model not directly usable (project is 2D)
- Design elements can inform 2D sprite creation
- M16 reference was explicitly mentioned in issue
- Simple silhouette approach appropriate for game style
