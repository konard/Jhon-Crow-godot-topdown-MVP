" --append-system-prompt "You are an AI issue solver. You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.
General guidelines.
   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.
   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.
   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.
   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:
      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-217-6e363ec134f9 --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha
      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA
      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log
      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures
      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs
      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.
      Note: If user says \"failing\" but tools show \"passing\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.
   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.
   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.
   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.
   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.
   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.
   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.

Initial research.
   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.
   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.
   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.
   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \"Could not process image\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \"HTML\" or \"text\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.
   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/217.
   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].
   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.
   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.
   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.
   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.
   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.
   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.
   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:
      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/221/comments --paginate
      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/221/comments --paginate
      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/221/reviews --paginate
      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!
   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/217/comments --paginate.

Solution development and testing.
   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.
   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.
   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.
   - When you test:
      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;
      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.
   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.
   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.
   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.
   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.
   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 221 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.

Preparing pull request.
   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.
   - When you commit, write clear message.
   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].
   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.
   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.
   - When you update existing pr 221, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.
   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.
   - When you finalize the pull request:
      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,
      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,
      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,
      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,
      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,
      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,
      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,
      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.
   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 221.

Workflow and collaboration.
   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.
   - When you push, push only to branch issue-217-6e363ec134f9.
   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-217-6e363ec134f9. (Note: PR 221 already exists, update it instead)
   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).
   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.
   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.
   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.
   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-217-6e363ec134f9.
   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.
   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 221 already exists for this branch.

Self review.
   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.
   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.
   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].
   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.

GitHub CLI command patterns.
   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).
   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.
   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\${owner}/\${repo}/pulls/\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.

Playwright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).
   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.
   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.
   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.
   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.
   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).
   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.
   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources." | jq -c .)

   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.
   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.
   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.
   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 221 --body "your message" to comment on existing PR.

Preparing pull request.
   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.
   - When you commit, write clear message.
   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].
   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.
   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.
   - When you update existing pr 221, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.
   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.
   - When you finalize the pull request:
      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,
      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,
      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,
      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,
      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,
      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,
      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,
      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.
   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 221.

Workflow and collaboration.
   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.
   - When you push, push only to branch issue-217-6e363ec134f9.
   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-217-6e363ec134f9. (Note: PR 221 already exists, update it instead)
   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).
   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.
   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.
   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.
   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-217-6e363ec134f9.
   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.
   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 221 already exists for this branch.

Self review.
   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.
   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.
   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].
   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.

GitHub CLI command patterns.
   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).
   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.
   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body "text" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body "text" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.

Playwright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).
   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.
   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.
   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.
   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.
   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).
   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.
   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.

            "text": "Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive summary report of my findings.\n\n## Godot Project Sprite/Model Structure Report\n\nI've thoroughly explored the Godot project and found a well-organized sprite and asset structure. Here are my findings:\n\n### 1. **Player Model/Sprite Files**\n\nThe player character uses a **modular, component-based sprite system**. All player sprites are located in:\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/assets/sprites/characters/player/`\n\n**Player Components:**\n- `player_body.png` - Main torso sprite\n- `player_head.png` - Head sprite\n- `player_left_arm.png` - Left arm sprite\n- `player_right_arm.png` - Right arm sprite\n- `player_combined_preview.png` - Preview showing all parts combined\n\n**Player Scene Definition:**\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/scenes/characters/Player.tscn`\n- Uses modular assembly via a `PlayerModel` node that combines individual body parts at specific Z-indexes and positions:\n  - Body (Z-index: 1, position: -4, 0)\n  - Head (Z-index: 3, position: -6, -2)\n  - Left Arm (Z-index: 4, position: 24, 6)\n  - Right Arm (Z-index: 4, position: -2, 6)\n- Includes a `WeaponMount` node for weapon attachment\n- Collision: CircleShape2D with radius 16.0\n- Threat sphere: Radius 150.0\n\n### 2. **Enemy Model/Sprite Files**\n\nEnemies use a **placeholder sprite system** but have detailed enemy definitions. Enemy sprites are located in:\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/assets/sprites/characters/`\n\n**Enemy Character Sprites:**\n- `soldier.png` - Basic soldier sprite\n- `soldier_spear.png` - Soldier with spear variant\n- `soldier_officer.png` - Officer variant\n\n**Enemy Scene Definition:**\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/scenes/objects/Enemy.tscn`\n- Currently uses a `PlaceholderTexture2D` (48x48) in red color for the main sprite\n- Includes `WeaponSprite` using `m16_rifle_topdown.png` weapon sprite\n- Collision: CircleShape2D with radius 24.0\n- Navigation: Uses NavigationAgent2D with max_speed: 320.0\n- Equipped with M16 rifle weapon\n\n### 3. **Project Asset Organization**\n\n**Directory Structure:**\n```\n/assets/\n├── sprites/\n│   ├── characters/\n│   │   ├── player/\n│   │   │   ├── player_body.png\n│   │   │   ├── player_head.png\n│   │   │   ├── player_left_arm.png\n│   │   │   ├── player_right_arm.png\n│   │   │   └── player_combined_preview.png\n│   │   ├── soldier.png\n│   │   ├── soldier_spear.png\n│   │   └── soldier_officer.png\n│   └── weapons/\n│       ├── m16_rifle_topdown.png\n│       ├── m16_rifle.png\n│       ├── m16_basic.png\n│       ├── m16_simple.png\n│       ├── m16_topdown_medium.png\n│       ├── m16_topdown_small.png\n│       ├── shotgun.png\n│       ├── shotgun_topdown.png\n│       ├── shotgun_icon.png\n│       ├── frag_grenade.png\n│       └── flashbang.png\n├── fonts/\n└── audio/\n\n/scenes/\n├── characters/\n│   └── Player.tscn (main player scene)\n├── objects/\n│   └── Enemy.tscn (enemy template scene)\n└── [other scene directories]\n\n/scripts/\n├── characters/\n│   └── player.gd (player controller script)\n└── objects/\n    ├── enemy.gd (enemy AI/behavior)\n    ├── hit_area.gd (damage detection)\n    ├── target.gd\n    └── grenade_target.gd\n```\n\n### 4. **Sprite Usage Pattern**\n\n**Player Construction:**\n- Modular approach: Body parts assembled at runtime with precise positioning\n- Weapon mounted separately via WeaponMount node\n- Supports dynamic animation through individual component rotation/positioning\n\n**Enemy Construction:**\n- Placeholder sprite currently in use (red circle with 48x48 size)\n- Actual soldier sprites available but not yet integrated\n- Weapon sprite displayed as overlay using `m16_rifle_topdown.png`\n- Red color tint applied via modulate property\n\n**Weapons:**\n- Separate weapon sprite system with multiple variants (M16 rifles, shotguns, grenades)\n- Top-down optimized versions available (`_topdown` suffix)\n- Multiple detail levels (basic, simple, medium)\n\n### 5. **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Player uses modular sprites** - Body parts are separate PNG files combined into a single character\n2. **Enemy uses a placeholder sprite** - The soldier sprites exist but aren't currently used; enemies render as red placeholders\n3. **Comprehensive weapon sprite library** - Multiple weapon variants for different gameplay scenarios\n4. **Well-organized directory structure** - Clear separation between characters, weapons, and other assets\n5. **Top-down perspective optimization** - Multiple top-down weapon variants suggest this is a top-down tactical shooter\n6. **Collision layers properly configured** - Player (layer 1), Enemies (layer 2), World (layer 4), Weapons (layer 16)\n\nAll files are absolute paths as requested in the response above."

        "text": "Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive summary report of my findings.\n\n## Godot Project Sprite/Model Structure Report\n\nI've thoroughly explored the Godot project and found a well-organized sprite and asset structure. Here are my findings:\n\n### 1. **Player Model/Sprite Files**\n\nThe player character uses a **modular, component-based sprite system**. All player sprites are located in:\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/assets/sprites/characters/player/`\n\n**Player Components:**\n- `player_body.png` - Main torso sprite\n- `player_head.png` - Head sprite\n- `player_left_arm.png` - Left arm sprite\n- `player_right_arm.png` - Right arm sprite\n- `player_combined_preview.png` - Preview showing all parts combined\n\n**Player Scene Definition:**\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/scenes/characters/Player.tscn`\n- Uses modular assembly via a `PlayerModel` node that combines individual body parts at specific Z-indexes and positions:\n  - Body (Z-index: 1, position: -4, 0)\n  - Head (Z-index: 3, position: -6, -2)\n  - Left Arm (Z-index: 4, position: 24, 6)\n  - Right Arm (Z-index: 4, position: -2, 6)\n- Includes a `WeaponMount` node for weapon attachment\n- Collision: CircleShape2D with radius 16.0\n- Threat sphere: Radius 150.0\n\n### 2. **Enemy Model/Sprite Files**\n\nEnemies use a **placeholder sprite system** but have detailed enemy definitions. Enemy sprites are located in:\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/assets/sprites/characters/`\n\n**Enemy Character Sprites:**\n- `soldier.png` - Basic soldier sprite\n- `soldier_spear.png` - Soldier with spear variant\n- `soldier_officer.png` - Officer variant\n\n**Enemy Scene Definition:**\n- `/tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769066205054/scenes/objects/Enemy.tscn`\n- Currently uses a `PlaceholderTexture2D` (48x48) in red color for the main sprite\n- Includes `WeaponSprite` using `m16_rifle_topdown.png` weapon sprite\n- Collision: CircleShape2D with radius 24.0\n- Navigation: Uses NavigationAgent2D with max_speed: 320.0\n- Equipped with M16 rifle weapon\n\n### 3. **Project Asset Organization**\n\n**Directory Structure:**\n```\n/assets/\n├── sprites/\n│   ├── characters/\n│   │   ├── player/\n│   │   │   ├── player_body.png\n│   │   │   ├── player_head.png\n│   │   │   ├── player_left_arm.png\n│   │   │   ├── player_right_arm.png\n│   │   │   └── player_combined_preview.png\n│   │   ├── soldier.png\n│   │   ├── soldier_spear.png\n│   │   └── soldier_officer.png\n│   └── weapons/\n│       ├── m16_rifle_topdown.png\n│       ├── m16_rifle.png\n│       ├── m16_basic.png\n│       ├── m16_simple.png\n│       ├── m16_topdown_medium.png\n│       ├── m16_topdown_small.png\n│       ├── shotgun.png\n│       ├── shotgun_topdown.png\n│       ├── shotgun_icon.png\n│       ├── frag_grenade.png\n│       └── flashbang.png\n├── fonts/\n└── audio/\n\n/scenes/\n├── characters/\n│   └── Player.tscn (main player scene)\n├── objects/\n│   └── Enemy.tscn (enemy template scene)\n└── [other scene directories]\n\n/scripts/\n├── characters/\n│   └── player.gd (player controller script)\n└── objects/\n    ├── enemy.gd (enemy AI/behavior)\n    ├── hit_area.gd (damage detection)\n    ├── target.gd\n    └── grenade_target.gd\n```\n\n### 4. **Sprite Usage Pattern**\n\n**Player Construction:**\n- Modular approach: Body parts assembled at runtime with precise positioning\n- Weapon mounted separately via WeaponMount node\n- Supports dynamic animation through individual component rotation/positioning\n\n**Enemy Construction:**\n- Placeholder sprite currently in use (red circle with 48x48 size)\n- Actual soldier sprites available but not yet integrated\n- Weapon sprite displayed as overlay using `m16_rifle_topdown.png`\n- Red color tint applied via modulate property\n\n**Weapons:**\n- Separate weapon sprite system with multiple variants (M16 rifles, shotguns, grenades)\n- Top-down optimized versions available (`_topdown` suffix)\n- Multiple detail levels (basic, simple, medium)\n\n### 5. **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Player uses modular sprites** - Body parts are separate PNG files combined into a single character\n2. **Enemy uses a placeholder sprite** - The soldier sprites exist but aren't currently used; enemies render as red placeholders\n3. **Comprehensive weapon sprite library** - Multiple weapon variants for different gameplay scenarios\n4. **Well-organized directory structure** - Clear separation between characters, weapons, and other assets\n5. **Top-down perspective optimization** - Multiple top-down weapon variants suggest this is a top-down tactical shooter\n6. **Collision layers properly configured** - Player (layer 1), Enemies (layer 2), World (layer 4), Weapons (layer 16)\n\nAll files are absolute paths as requested in the response above."

Shell Count Reduction\\nChanged `MaxReserveAmmo` from 24 to 12 in `resources/weapons/ShotgunData.tres`. With 8 shells in the tube magazine, this gives exactly 20 total shells on the building level as requested.\\n\\n**Bug fix in Shotgun._Ready()**: \\n- Fixed MagazineInventory initialization to use 2 magazines (one CurrentMagazine set to 0, one spare with reserve shells)\\n- The `ReserveAmmo` property returns `TotalSpareAmmo`, so reserve shells must be in spare magazines\\n- Updated `LoadShell()` to consume from spare magazines correctly\\n\\n### 2. Reserve Ammo Display Fix\\n**Root cause:** The `ShellCountChanged` signal was emitted during `_Ready()` before the shotgun was added to the player's children. GDScript handlers couldn't find the shotgun to read `ReserveAmmo`.\\n\\n**Fix:** Use `CallDeferred(MethodName.EmitInitialShellCount)` to emit the signal after the shotgun is added to the scene tree. This ensures the display correctly shows \\\"8/12\\\" instead of \\\"8/0\\\".\\n\\n### 3. Continuous Reload Gestures (Bolt Open/Close Only)\\nAdded `TryProcessMidDragGesture()` method in `Scripts/Weapons/Shotgun.cs` that enables:\\n\\n**New fluid reload motion for bolt:**\\n1. Hold RMB and drag UP → opens bolt\\n2. Without releasing RMB, drag DOWN → closes bolt\\n\\n**Also works for pump-action after firing:**\\n1. Fire with LMB (shotgun enters NeedsPumpUp state)\\n2. Hold RMB and drag UP → ejects spent shell\\n3. Without releasing RMB, drag DOWN → chambers next round\\n\\n### 4. Shell Loading Behavior (Preserved Original)\\nShell loading with MMB continues to use the original release-based gesture:\\n- Open bolt (RMB drag UP, release)\\n- Load shell (MMB + RMB drag DOWN, release)\\n- Close bolt (RMB drag DOWN, release)\\n\\n**Why:** Based on user feedback, the original shell loading behavior provides better control and intentionality.\\n\\n### 5. Bolt Close Cooldown Protection\\nAdded **750ms** cooldown (history: 250ms → 400ms → 500ms → 750ms) after closing the bolt to prevent accidental reopening due to continued mouse movement:\\n- After `CompleteReload()` (reload completion)\\n- After pump-down (mid-drag and release-based gestures)\\n\\n**Why:** User reported accidental bolt reopening during pump-action sequences. Increased cooldown provides more robust protection.\\n\\n**Verbose logging enabled:** Game now outputs detailed timing information to help diagnose remaining issues.\\n\\n### 6. Backward Compatibility\\nOriginal release-based gestures still work for all operations:\\n- RMB drag UP (release) → action\\n- RMB drag DOWN (release) → action\\n\\n## User Feedback Integration (6 rounds)\\n\\n1. **\\\"keep original shell loading\\\"** → Preserved release-based shell loading, kept continuous bolt open/close\\n2. **\\\"accidental bolt opens after closing\\\"** → Added 250ms cooldown\\n3. **\\\"still happens during pump-action\\\"** → Increased to 400ms\\n4. **\\\"still 8+24 shells\\\"** → Fixed MagazineInventory initialization\\n5. **\\\"now 8 total (should be 8+12)\\\"** → Fixed to use spare magazines\\n6. **\\\"still 8/0 display, still accidental opens\\\"** → Fixed signal timing with CallDeferred, increased cooldown to 750ms\\n\\n## Test Plan\\n\\n- [x] Verify building level starts with 20 total shells (8 in tube + 12 reserve)\\n- [x] Test continuous bolt open/close: hold RMB, drag up, then down without releasing\\n- [x] Test old reload gestures: RMB drag up (release), then RMB drag down (release)\\n- [x] Test continuous pump-action after firing\\n- [x] Verify shell loading uses original behavior (requires RMB release)\\n- [ ] Verify reserve ammo display shows 12 (not 0) at game start\\n- [ ] Verify bolt close cooldown (750ms) prevents accidental reopening during pump-action\\n\\n## Case Study\\n\\nDocumentation added to `docs/case-studies/issue-210/` with:\\n- Timeline of events\\n- User feedback analysis (6 rounds)\\n- Root cause analysis for each issue\\n- Resolution details\\n- User-provided game logs\\n\\nFixes #210\\n\\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\",\"number\":215,\"title\":\"Update shotgun: 20 shells + continuous reload gestures\"},{\"body\":\"## Summary\\n- Fix input processing order to detect MMB presses on first reload attempt\\n- Initialize MMB tracking flag based on current state instead of unconditionally resetting\\n- Add diagnostic logging flag for debugging similar issues\\n\\n## Problem\\nAfter opening the bolt (RMB drag UP) and trying to load a shell (MMB + RMB drag DOWN) for the **first time**, the bolt closes instead of loading a shell.

    "stdout": "[{\"body\":\"## Summary\\n\\n- Reduce total shotgun shells to 20 (8 in tube + 12 reserve)\\n- Add continuous drag-and-drop reload gestures for bolt open/close\\n- Preserve backward compatibility with release-based gestures\\n- **Updated**: Shell loading behavior preserved as original (requires RMB release)\\n- **Fixed**: Increased cooldown protection (750ms) to prevent accidental bolt reopening\\n- **Fixed**: Shell count now correctly uses spare magazines for ReserveAmmo\\n- **Fixed**: Reserve ammo display now shows correctly (signal timing fix)\\n\\n## Changes\\n\\n### 1. Shell Count Reduction\\nChanged `MaxReserveAmmo` from 24 to 12 in `resources/weapons/ShotgunData.tres`. With 8 shells in the tube magazine, this gives exactly 20 total shells on the building level as requested.\\n\\n**Bug fix in Shotgun._Ready()**: \\n- Fixed MagazineInventory initialization to use 2 magazines (one CurrentMagazine set to 0, one spare with reserve shells)\\n- The `ReserveAmmo` property returns `TotalSpareAmmo`, so reserve shells must be in spare magazines\\n- Updated `LoadShell()` to consume from spare magazines correctly\\n\\n### 2. Reserve Ammo Display Fix\\n**Root cause:** The `ShellCountChanged` signal was emitted during `_Ready()` before the shotgun was added to the player's children. GDScript handlers couldn't find the shotgun to read `ReserveAmmo`.\\n\\n**Fix:** Use `CallDeferred(MethodName.EmitInitialShellCount)` to emit the signal after the shotgun is added to the scene tree. This ensures the display correctly shows \\\"8/12\\\" instead of \\\"8/0\\\".\\n\\n### 3. Continuous Reload Gestures (Bolt Open/Close Only)\\nAdded `TryProcessMidDragGesture()` method in `Scripts/Weapons/Shotgun.cs` that enables:\\n\\n**New fluid reload motion for bolt:**\\n1. Hold RMB and drag UP → opens bolt\\n2. Without releasing RMB, drag DOWN → closes bolt\\n\\n**Also works for pump-action after firing:**\\n1. Fire with LMB (shotgun enters NeedsPumpUp state)\\n2. Hold RMB and drag UP → ejects spent shell\\n3. Without releasing RMB, drag DOWN → chambers next round\\n\\n### 4. Shell Loading Behavior (Preserved Original)\\nShell loading with MMB continues to use the original release-based gesture:\\n- Open bolt (RMB drag UP, release)\\n- Load shell (MMB + RMB drag DOWN, release)\\n- Close bolt (RMB drag DOWN, release)\\n\\n**Why:** Based on user feedback, the original shell loading behavior provides better control and intentionality.\\n\\n### 5. Bolt Close Cooldown Protection\\nAdded **750ms** cooldown (history: 250ms → 400ms → 500ms → 750ms) after closing the bolt to prevent accidental reopening due to continued mouse movement:\\n- After `CompleteReload()` (reload completion)\\n- After pump-down (mid-drag and release-based gestures)\\n\\n**Why:** User reported accidental bolt reopening during pump-action sequences. Increased cooldown provides more robust protection.\\n\\n**Verbose logging enabled:** Game now outputs detailed timing information to help diagnose remaining issues.\\n\\n### 6. Backward Compatibility\\nOriginal release-based gestures still work for all operations:\\n- RMB drag UP (release) → action\\n- RMB drag DOWN (release) → action\\n\\n## User Feedback Integration (6 rounds)\\n\\n1. **\\\"keep original shell loading\\\"** → Preserved release-based shell loading, kept continuous bolt open/close\\n2. **\\\"accidental bolt opens after closing\\\"** → Added 250ms cooldown\\n3. **\\\"still happens during pump-action\\\"** → Increased to 400ms\\n4. **\\\"still 8+24 shells\\\"** → Fixed MagazineInventory initialization\\n5. **\\\"now 8 total (should be 8+12)\\\"** → Fixed to use spare magazines\\n6. **\\\"still 8/0 display, still accidental opens\\\"** → Fixed signal timing with CallDeferred, increased cooldown to 750ms\\n\\n## Test Plan\\n\\n- [x] Verify building level starts with 20 total shells (8 in tube + 12 reserve)\\n- [x] Test continuous bolt open/close: hold RMB, drag up, then down without releasing\\n- [x] Test old reload gestures: RMB drag up (release), then RMB drag down (release)\\n- [x] Test continuous pump-action after firing\\n- [x] Verify shell loading uses original behavior (requires RMB release)\\n- [ ] Verify reserve ammo display shows 12 (not 0) at game start\\n- [ ] Verify bolt close cooldown (750ms) prevents accidental reopening during pump-action\\n\\n## Case Study\\n\\nDocumentation added to `docs/case-studies/issue-210/` with:\\n- Timeline of events\\n- User feedback analysis (6 rounds)\\n- Root cause analysis for each issue\\n- Resolution details\\n- User-provided game logs\\n\\nFixes #210\\n\\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\",\"number\":215,\"title\":\"Update shotgun: 20 shells + continuous reload gestures\"},{\"body\":\"## Summary\\n- Fix input processing order to detect MMB presses on first reload attempt\\n- Initialize MMB tracking flag based on current state instead of unconditionally resetting\\n- Add diagnostic logging flag for debugging similar issues\\n\\n## Problem\\nAfter opening the bolt (RMB drag UP) and trying to load a shell (MMB + RMB drag DOWN) for the **first time**, the bolt closes instead of loading a shell.
