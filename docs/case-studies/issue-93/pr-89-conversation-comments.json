PURSUING State Fix\n- **Reduced wait time** at cover from 2.5s to 1.5s (within the requested 1-2 second range)\n- **Added fallback behavior** when no pursuit cover is found:\n  - If player is visible → transition to COMBAT\n  - If flanking is enabled → try FLANKING\n  - Otherwise → direct COMBAT approach\n- **Debug labels** now show `(WAIT Xs)` or `(MOVING)` phases\n\n### 2. COMBAT State Fix\nThe core issue was that enemies would stand still and shoot without moving toward the player. Now the COMBAT state has two distinct phases:\n\n**Phase 1 - APPROACH:**\n- Enemy moves toward player while shooting\n- Continues until within 250px of player OR 2 seconds have passed\n- Debug label shows `(APPROACH)`\n\n**Phase 2 - EXPOSED:**\n- Enemy stands still and shoots for 2-3 seconds\n- Then returns to cover via SEEKING_COVER state\n- Debug label shows `(EXPOSED Xs)`\n\n### Case Study Documentation\nCreated `docs/case-studies/issue-88/analysis.md` with detailed analysis of the issues and solutions.\n\n### Testing\nTo verify the changes:\n1. Press F7 to enable debug mode\n2. Watch the debug labels above enemies to see the phases\n3. COMBAT: Should show `(APPROACH)` then `(EXPOSED Xs)`\n4. PURSUING: Should show `(WAIT Xs)` then `(MOVING)`\n\n---\n*This addresses the feedback about enemies standing still in both PURSUING and COMBAT

Here's what I found:\n\n### Bug 1: PURSUING State - Visibility Check Bug (Critical)\n\nThe code at line 1285 was:\n```gdscript\nif distance < 15.0 or not _is_visible_from_player():\n    # Reached cover or hidden from player\n```\n\n**Problem**: When an enemy starts the PURSUING state from cover, they are ALREADY not visible from the player. This means `_is_visible_from_player()` returns `false` immediately, so the condition `not _is_visible_from_player()` is `true` before any movement happens!\n\n**Result**: Enemy instantly considers they've \"reached\" their target cover → resets to waiting phase → infinite loop.\n\n**Fix**: Removed the visibility check. Only distance matters:\n```gdscript\nif distance < 15.0:\n    # Reached pursuit cover\n```\n\n### Bug 2: PURSUING State - Cover Too Close\n\nThe `_find_pursuit_cover_toward_player()` function could find covers that were only a few pixels away from the enemy's current position.\n\n**Problem**: If cover B is 10 pixels from cover A, the enemy \"reaches\" it immediately (since 10 < 15), resets, and loops again.\n\n**Fix**: Added minimum 30px distance check for pursuit covers.\n\n### Bug 3: COMBAT State - Wrong Transition\n\nWhen the player hid from sight during COMBAT, the enemy was transitioning to FLANKING or IDLE instead of PURSUING.\n\n**Fix**: Now transitions to PURSUING, which is the correct state for chasing a hidden player.\n\n### Testing Notes\n\nWith F7 debug mode enabled, you should now see:\n- **PURSUING**: `(WAIT 1.5s)` → `(MOVING)` → enemy actually moves to next cover → `(WAIT 1.5s)` at new cover\n- **COMBAT**: `(APPROACH)` → enemy moves toward player → `(EXPOSED 2.5s)` → returns to cover\n\nThe case study has been updated with full analysis in `docs/case-studies/issue-88/analysis.md`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764425900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764426444","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/89#issuecomment-3764426444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/89","id":3764426444,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87gYJbM","user":{"login":"konard","id":1431904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard","html_url":"https://github.com/konard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-17T22:47:55Z","updated_at":"2026-01-17T22:47:55Z","body":"## 🤖 Solution Draft Log\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\n\n💰 **Cost estimation:**\n- Calculated by Anthropic: $1.786309 USD\n📎 **Log file uploaded as Gist** (697KB)\n🔗 [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/konard/c14747aa6e810b54addd97226dd5b958/raw/ed06ee1d8962465c17aa47649d9c58a8e46711c9/solution-draft-log-pr-1768690070634.txt)\n---\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3764426444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
