# Case Study: Issue #99 - Group AI Tactical Behavior

## Overview

**Issue**: [#99 - update ai групповая тактика](https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/99)
**Status**: In Progress
**Affected Component**: Enemy AI System (GOAP)
**Created By**: Jhon-Crow

## Issue Summary

The request is to implement group behavior for enemies that are within communication distance of each other. The communication range should be approximately 1/4 of the viewport (the distance at which they could realistically talk and hear each other).

### Original Requirements (Russian → English)

> добавь групповое поведение близко друг к другу находящихся врагов (на расстоянии, на котором они могли бы переговариваться и звук долетал бы, примерно четверти вьюпорта).

**Translation**: Add group behavior for enemies that are close to each other (at a distance where they could communicate and sound would reach, approximately a quarter of the viewport).

### Reference Material

The issue references tactical building clearance techniques from [poligon64.ru](https://poligon64.ru/tactics/70-building-catch-tactics) which describes:
- Team-based room clearance (3-5 person teams)
- Sector-based responsibility zones
- Entry techniques (Hook, Cross, Corner, Diagonal)
- Communication protocols (coded terms: "Red", "Green", "Working")
- Formation maintenance with physical/visual contact

### Additional Requirements

1. Integrate this behavior into the existing GOAP system
2. Preserve all existing behavior in the executable

## Existing System Analysis

### Current AI Architecture

The game uses a sophisticated AI system with the following components:

1. **AI States** (9 states):
   - IDLE, COMBAT, SEEKING_COVER, IN_COVER, FLANKING
   - SUPPRESSED, RETREATING, PURSUING, ASSAULT

2. **GOAP System** (14 actions):
   - AttackDistractedPlayerAction, AttackVulnerablePlayerAction
   - PursueVulnerablePlayerAction, RetreatWithFireAction
   - AssaultPlayerAction, ReturnFireAction, EngagePlayerAction
   - PursuePlayerAction, FlankPlayerAction, RetreatAction
   - FindCoverAction, SeekCoverAction, StaySuppressedAction, PatrolAction

3. **Existing Group Coordination**:
   - `_count_enemies_in_combat()` function counts enemies in combat states
   - `AssaultPlayerAction` triggers when 2+ enemies are in combat
   - 5-second wait period before coordinated assault
   - Sound propagation system for alerting nearby enemies

### Current Communication Constants

From `sound_propagation.gd`:
```gdscript
const VIEWPORT_WIDTH: float = 1280.0
const VIEWPORT_HEIGHT: float = 720.0
const VIEWPORT_DIAGONAL: float = 1468.6  # sqrt(1280² + 720²)
```

### Calculated Communication Range

Per the issue requirement (1/4 viewport):
- **Viewport diagonal**: 1468.6 pixels
- **Communication range**: 367.15 pixels (1468.6 / 4)
- **Rounded value**: 360 pixels (practical value)

This is about half of the gunshot propagation range (1468.6px) and less than reload sound range (900px), which makes sense - verbal/tactical communication has shorter range than loud noises.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Group Behavior is Needed

1. **Current Limitation**: Enemies operate independently with minimal coordination
2. **Existing AssaultPlayerAction**: Only counts enemies in combat, doesn't coordinate tactics
3. **No Formation/Role System**: Enemies don't assume complementary roles
4. **No Spatial Awareness**: Enemies don't consider positions of nearby allies

### Key Insights from Research

#### From F.E.A.R. (GOAP Pioneer)
> "None of the enemy AI in FEAR know that each other exists and co-operative behaviours are simply two AI characters being given goals that line up nicely to create what look like coordinated behaviours."

This reveals that even F.E.A.R. didn't have true squad coordination - it was designed to appear coordinated.

#### From Days Gone
- Uses "Frontline" concept for spatial coordination
- Lane assignments minimize travel distances
- Confidence system affects squad aggression
- Flanking detection with timed responses

#### From Brothers in Arms
- Fire team provides suppression
- Assault team attacks in close quarters
- Both friendly and enemy AI use same tactics

## Proposed Solution

### Design Philosophy

Based on the reference material (Russian military tactics), the system should:

1. **Enable verbal communication** between nearby enemies (1/4 viewport range)
2. **Assign tactical roles** based on position and situation
3. **Coordinate actions** like flanking, suppression, and assault
4. **Maintain formation** when multiple enemies are present

### New GOAP World State Variables

```gdscript
# Group coordination state
"squad_size": int,              # Number of enemies in communication range
"has_squad": bool,              # true if squad_size >= 2
"squad_role": SquadRole,        # This enemy's current role
"squad_formation": bool,        # Whether in tactical formation
"squad_suppressing": bool,      # Squad is providing suppression fire
"squad_flanking": bool,         # Squad has flanker in position
"squad_leader": bool,           # This enemy is the squad leader
```

### New AI States

```gdscript
enum SquadRole {
    NONE,           # Operating independently
    LEADER,         # Coordinates squad, makes tactical decisions
    SUPPRESSOR,     # Provides covering fire
    FLANKER,        # Moves to flank position
    ASSAULT,        # Primary attacker
    REAR_GUARD      # Covers retreat path
}
```

### New GOAP Actions

1. **ProvideSuppressionAction**: Keep player pinned while allies flank
2. **CoordinatedFlankAction**: Flank while suppressor provides cover
3. **StackFormationAction**: Form up near doorways/corners
4. **CrossCoverAction**: Move between covers with overwatch
5. **BoundingOverwatchAction**: Alternating movement with cover

### Communication Range Constant

```gdscript
## Distance at which enemies can communicate verbally (1/4 viewport diagonal)
const SQUAD_COMMUNICATION_RANGE: float = 360.0
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Squad Detection System
- Add `_find_squad_members()` function
- Create squad membership tracking
- Implement leader election (closest to player or most HP)

### Phase 2: Role Assignment
- Add SquadRole enum
- Implement `_assign_squad_role()` function
- Add role-based cost modifiers to existing actions

### Phase 3: New GOAP Actions
- Create suppression action
- Create coordinated flank action
- Update GOAP planner with new actions

### Phase 4: Communication System
- Add "silent communication" for enemies in range
- Share player position knowledge
- Coordinate timing of attacks

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
- Test with 2-5 enemy groups
- Verify existing behaviors preserved
- Balance timing parameters

## Files to Modify

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/objects/enemy.gd` | Add squad detection, role system, new state variables |
| `scripts/ai/enemy_actions.gd` | Add new group-focused GOAP actions |
| `scripts/ai/goap_planner.gd` | Update if needed for new actions |

## Success Criteria

1. Enemies within 360px form tactical squads
2. Squad members assume complementary roles
3. Visible coordination (suppression while flanking)
4. All existing individual behaviors preserved
5. Natural-looking group movements
6. No performance degradation with multiple squads
