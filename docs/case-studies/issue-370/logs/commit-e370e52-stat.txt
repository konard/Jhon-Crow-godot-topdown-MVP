    Round 3 blood effect improvements: edge scaling, no overlap, matte drops, unlimited decals
    
    Addresses feedback from issue #293:
    
    1. Edge-based scaling: Drops farther from center are now smaller (EDGE_DROP_SCALE_MIN=0.4)
       - More realistic blood spatter pattern where edge drops are naturally smaller
    
    2. Satellite drop overlap prevention: New drops check against existing positions
       - Added SATELLITE_MIN_SEPARATION constant (4px minimum distance)
       - Tries up to 5 positions before skipping to avoid overlapping existing drops
    
    3. Matte blood drops: Updated BloodDecal.tscn gradient for less visible borders
       - Gradient now has longer solid region (0-75%) before soft fade
       - Reduces visible boundaries when drops overlap
    
    4. Unlimited decals: Puddles should never disappear
       - MAX_BLOOD_DECALS set to 0 (unlimited)
       - Auto-fade disabled by default in blood_decal.gd
       - Cleanup loops now check for limit > 0 before removing
    
    5. Added Round 3 feedback files to case study documentation
