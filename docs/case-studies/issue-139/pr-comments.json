Control hints removed from other levels ✅\n- Removed `InstructionsLabel` from `scenes/levels/TestTier.tscn`\n- Removed `InstructionsLabel` from `scenes/levels/BuildingLevel.tscn`\n- Removed the code that was updating these labels from `test_tier.gd` and `building_level.gd`\n\n### 2. Ammo count added to tutorial level ✅\n- Added `AmmoLabel` to `scenes/levels/csharp/TestTier.tscn`\n- Added ammo tracking functionality to `tutorial_level.gd` (same as other levels)\n- Supports both C# Player (via `AmmoChanged` signal) and GDScript Player\n\n### 3. Fixed tutorial prompts not appearing in compiled exe ✅\nThe issue was with the screen position calculation. The original code used:\n```gdscript\nvar camera := get_viewport().get_camera_2d()\nvar screen_pos := _player.global_position - camera.global_position + get_viewport().size / 2.0\n```\n\nThis doesn't work correctly in exported builds due to viewport size differences. Fixed to use:\n```gdscript\nvar canvas_transform: Transform2D = get_viewport().get_canvas_transform()\nvar screen_pos: Vector2 = canvas_transform * _player.global_position\n```\n\nThis uses Godot's built-in canvas transform which correctly converts world coordinates to screen coordinates in both editor and exported builds.\n\n### Case Study\nI also created a case study document at `docs/case-studies/issue-139/README.md` with:\n- Timeline of events\n- Root cause analysis for each issue\n- Technical insights\n- Complete solution draft log from the initial implementation\n\nPlease test the compiled exe again to verify the fixes work correctly!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3774412154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3774413813","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/142#issuecomment-3774413813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/142","id":3774413813,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87g-Pv1","user":{"login":"konard","id":1431904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard","html_url":"https://github.com/konard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-20T18:45:27Z","updated_at":"2026-01-20T18:45:27Z","body":"## 🤖 Solution Draft Log\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\n\n💰 **Cost estimation:**\n- Public pricing estimate: $8.102538 USD\n- Calculated by Anthropic: $4.215522 USD\n- Difference: $-3.887016 (-47.97%)\n📎 **Log file uploaded as Gist** (1117KB)\n🔗 [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/konard/fc094f98447828f9f0bcef1dcf6dc703/raw/8f762bd98d1fbb4979165c7ff581ecd05f5b4a78/solution-draft-log-pr-1768934722296.txt)\n---\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3774413813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3774430327","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/142#issuecomment-3774430327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/142","id":3774430327,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87g-Tx3","user":{"login":"Jhon-Crow","id":133867474,"node_id":"U_kgDOB_qn0g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133867474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jhon-Crow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-20T18:49:45Z","updated_at":"2026-01-20T18:50:09Z","body":"перезарядка не r, а последовательность r -> f -> r.\r\nтак же добавь пункт обучения только если у игрока в руках штурмовая винтовка -
