# Case Study: Issue #382 - Tactical Enemy Grenade Throwing

## Issue Summary

**Issue**: [сделай тактическое метание гранаты врагом](https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/382)

**Translation**: "Make tactical grenade throwing by enemy"

**Reporter**: Jhon-Crow

**Date**: 2026-01-25

## Problem Statement

The issue requests implementing a complex tactical grenade throwing behavior for enemies that includes:

1. **Pre-throw Communication**: The grenade thrower ("метатель") warns allies in the throw trajectory or expected blast zone
2. **Ally Evacuation**: Warned allies evacuate the danger zone with maximum priority
3. **Thrower Positioning**: The thrower moves to throwing range or to cover that protects from player rays (ignoring one cover)
4. **Throw Inaccuracy**: Random deviation within a 10-degree sector (max 5 degrees either direction)
5. **Post-Warning Coordination**: All evacuated allies wait for the explosion, then begin a coordinated assault
6. **Cover Emergence**: Thrower exits cover if needed to throw the grenade
7. **Post-Throw Behavior**: After throwing, the thrower aims at the target location and approaches to safe distance
8. **Cover-Seeking for Non-Lethal Grenades**: For non-offensive grenades, thrower hides behind cover that blocks rays from the impact point
9. **Post-Explosion Assault**: Immediately after explosion, the thrower assaults through the passage used for the throw

**Trigger Condition**: Enemy enters this state when the player appears in their field of view and disappears without initiating aggressive actions.

## Detailed Requirements Analysis

### Phase 1: Grenade Readiness Detection
- Enemy sees player briefly, player disappears without aggression
- This creates a tactical opportunity for grenade attack

### Phase 2: Zone Communication (New Feature)
- Thrower broadcasts intent to throw grenade
- Message includes: target position, expected blast radius
- Allies within blast zone + throw trajectory receive notification

### Phase 3: Ally Evacuation (New Feature)
- Allies receive evacuation priority boost (highest)
- Calculate nearest safe direction (perpendicular or away from blast)
- Move to safety immediately

### Phase 4: Thrower Positioning
- Find position within throwing range
- OR find cover that provides protection from player's rays
- "Ignoring one cover" = can find position that requires bypassing single obstacle

### Phase 5: Execution
- Exit cover if necessary
- Apply random inaccuracy (5 degrees max)
- Throw grenade

### Phase 6: Post-Throw Behavior
- Aim at impact location
- Move to safe distance from blast
- For non-lethal grenades: seek cover that blocks rays from impact point

### Phase 7: Coordinated Assault
- All allies wait in evacuation positions
- Upon explosion, commence assault
- Thrower leads through the "passage" (doorway/opening) used for throw

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Existing Grenade System

The project already has a sophisticated grenade system:

**EnemyGrenadeComponent** (`scripts/components/enemy_grenade_component.gd`):
- 7 trigger conditions for grenade throwing
- Trigger 1: Suppression (hidden for 6+ seconds after being fired at)
- Trigger 2: Pursuit (player approaching fast while under fire)
- Trigger 3: Witnessed Kills (saw 2+ allies killed)
- Trigger 4: Vulnerable Sound (heard reload/empty click)
- Trigger 5: Sustained Fire (10+ seconds of gunfire in same zone)
- Trigger 6: Desperation (1 HP left)
- Trigger 7: Suspicion (medium+ confidence, player hidden 3+ seconds)
- Safety checks: blast radius + safety margin
- Path clearance verification
- Throw delay and cooldown mechanics

**Grenade Types**:
- `FragGrenade` - Offensive, impact-triggered, 225px radius, 99 damage, 4 shrapnel
- `FlashbangGrenade` - Non-lethal, blinds enemies

### Existing AI System

**GOAP Planner** (`scripts/ai/goap_planner.gd`):
- A* search for optimal action sequences
- World state-based planning
- Cost-based action selection

**Enemy Actions** (`scripts/ai/enemy_actions.gd`):
- SeekCoverAction
- EngagePlayerAction
- FlankPlayerAction
- RetreatAction / RetreatWithFireAction
- PursuePlayerAction
- AssaultPlayerAction (disabled per issue #169)
- AttackDistractedPlayerAction
- AttackVulnerablePlayerAction
- Various investigation actions based on confidence

**Enemy Memory** (`scripts/ai/enemy_memory.gd`):
- Position tracking with confidence decay
- Behavior modes: direct_pursuit, cautious_approach, search, patrol

**Cover Component** (`scripts/components/cover_component.gd`):
- Raycast-based cover detection
- Cover quality evaluation
- Pursuit cover finding

### Current AI States

```
IDLE (patrol/guard)
  ↓ (sees player)
COMBAT
  ↓ (under fire)
SEEKING_COVER → IN_COVER
  ↓ (suppressed)
SUPPRESSED
  ↓ (retreating)
RETREATING
  ↓ (pursuing)
PURSUING → ASSAULT (disabled)
  ↓ (searching)
SEARCHING
```

## Gap Analysis

### What Exists vs What's Needed

| Feature | Current State | Required |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Grenade throwing triggers | 7 conditions implemented | New trigger: player seen then disappeared |
| Blast zone calculation | ✅ Effect radius known | ✅ Sufficient |
| Ally communication | ❌ None | Broadcast system needed |
| Ally evacuation | ❌ None | Priority movement to safety |
| Throw trajectory check | ✅ Path clearance | Need trajectory zone check |
| Cover ignoring mechanic | ❌ None | Complex ray check system |
| Post-throw positioning | ❌ None | Safe distance movement |
| Coordinated assault | ❌ Disabled (issue #169) | Re-enable with new trigger |
| Assault waiting | ❌ None | Post-explosion timing |

## Architecture Notes

### Code Size Constraint

The `scripts/objects/enemy.gd` file has a CI-enforced limit of 5000 lines. Current implementation should extract new logic to separate components.

### Recommended Component Architecture

1. **TacticalGrenadeCoordinator** (new autoload)
   - Manages grenade throw announcements
   - Tracks enemies in danger zones
   - Coordinates assault timing

2. **EnemyGrenadeComponent** (extend existing)
   - Add new trigger: "player_seen_then_hidden"
   - Add ally notification call

3. **EnemyEvacuationBehavior** (new or extend enemy.gd)
   - Listen for grenade warnings
   - Calculate safe evacuation direction
   - Track "waiting for assault" state

## Proposed Solutions

See `logs/proposed-solutions.md` for detailed implementation approaches.
