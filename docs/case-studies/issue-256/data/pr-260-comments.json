C# код всё ещё вызывал старый метод `throw_grenade()` с drag distance, а не новый `throw_grenade_velocity_based()`.\n\nThe issue was that the game uses **C# code (Player.cs)**, not GDScript (player.gd). The C# code was still calling the legacy `throw_grenade()` method with drag distance instead of the new `throw_grenade_velocity_based()`.\n\n### Доказательство в логах / Evidence in Logs\n\n```\n[GrenadeBase] LEGACY throw_grenade() called! Direction: (0.996999, 0.077419), Speed: 2484.6\n[GrenadeBase] NOTE: Using DRAG-BASED system. If velocity-based is expected...\n```\n\n### Что исправлено / What's Fixed\n\n1. **Player.cs теперь отслеживает скорость мыши** - используя историю из 5 последних замеров для сглаживания\n2. **ThrowGrenade() вызывает throw_grenade_velocity_based()** - с реальной скоростью мыши на момент отпускания\n3. **Добавлен лог при запуске** - показывает какая система бросков активна\n\n### Ожидаемое поведение / Expected Behavior After Rebuild\n\n1. При запуске игры в логах появится:\n   ```\n   [Player.Grenade] Throwing system: VELOCITY-BASED (v2.0 - mouse velocity at release)\n   ```\n\n2. При броске с остановленной мышкой:\n   ```\n   [Player.Grenade] Velocity-based throw! Mouse velocity: (0, 0) (0.0 px/s), Swing distance: 150.0\n   ```\n   → Граната падает под ноги игрока\n\n3. При броске с быстрым движением мыши:\n   ```\n   [Player.Grenade] Velocity-based throw! Mouse velocity: (1500, 200) (1513.3 px/s), Swing distance: 300.0\n   ```\n   → Граната летит далеко\n\nПожалуйста, пересоберите проект (включая C# rebuild) и протестируйте.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3786524962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3786527884","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/260#issuecomment-3786527884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/260","id":3786527884,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87hsdSM","user":{"login":"konard","id":1431904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard","html_url":"https://github.com/konard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-22T20:22:31Z","updated_at":"2026-01-22T20:22:31Z","body":"##

You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.\nGeneral guidelines.\n   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.\n   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:\n      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-256-a4e979be411d --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha\n      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA\n      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log\n      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures\n      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs\n      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.\n      Note: If user says \\\"failing\\\" but tools show \\\"passing\\\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\n\nInitial research.\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\n   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \\\"Could not process image\\\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \\\"HTML\\\" or \\\"text\\\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256.\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\n   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:\n      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/260/comments --paginate\n      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \\\"gh pr view --json comments\\\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256/comments --paginate.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 260 --body \\\"your message\\\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 260, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 260.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d. (Note: PR 260 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 260 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\\${owner}/\\${repo}/pulls/\\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\n\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\" | jq -c .)\n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.680Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.681Z] [INFO] 📋 User prompt:\n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.682Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.682Z] [INFO] Issue to solve: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256\nYour prepared branch: issue-256-a4e979be411d\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769116661429\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/260\nYour forked repository: konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\nOriginal repository (upstream): Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP\nGitHub Actions on your fork: https://github.com/konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP/actions?query=branch%3Aissue-256-a4e979be411d\n\nNew comments on the pull request: 3\nPull request description was edited after last commit\n\nContinue.\n\n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.682Z] [INFO] ---END USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.682Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.683Z] [INFO] 📋 System prompt:\n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.683Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN SYSTEM PROMPT---\n[2026-01-22T21:18:01.684Z] [INFO] You are an AI issue solver.

You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.\nGeneral guidelines.\n   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.\n   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:\n      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-256-a4e979be411d --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha\n      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA\n      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log\n      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures\n      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs\n      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.\n      Note: If user says \\\"failing\\\" but tools show \\\"passing\\\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\n\nInitial research.\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\n   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \\\"Could not process image\\\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \\\"HTML\\\" or \\\"text\\\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256.\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\n   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:\n      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/260/comments --paginate\n      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \\\"gh pr view --json comments\\\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256/comments --paginate.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 260 --body \\\"your message\\\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 260, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 260.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d. (Note: PR 260 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 260 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\\${owner}/\\${repo}/pulls/\\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\n\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\" | jq -c .)\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.313Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.314Z] [INFO] 📋 User prompt:\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.314Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.314Z] [INFO] Issue to solve: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256\nYour prepared branch: issue-256-a4e979be411d\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769185396188\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/260\nYour forked repository: konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\nOriginal repository (upstream): Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP\nGitHub Actions on your fork: https://github.com/konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP/actions?query=branch%3Aissue-256-a4e979be411d\n\nNew comments on the pull request: 4\nPull request description was edited after last commit\n\nContinue.\n\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.314Z] [INFO] ---END USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.314Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.314Z] [INFO] 📋 System prompt:\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.314Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN SYSTEM PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.315Z] [INFO] You are an AI issue solver.

PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256/comments --paginate.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 260 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 260, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 260.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d. (Note: PR 260 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 260 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\n\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.315Z] [INFO] ---END SYSTEM PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.315Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.316Z] [INFO] 📊 CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS: 64000\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.317Z] [INFO] 📋 Command details:          \n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.317Z] [INFO]   📂 Working directory:      /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769185396188\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.317Z] [INFO]   🌿 Branch:                 issue-256-a4e979be411d\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.317Z] [INFO]   🤖 Model:                  Claude OPUS\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.317Z] [INFO]   🍴 Fork:                   konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.317Z] [INFO] \n▶️ Streaming output:         \n\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.323Z] [INFO] /bin/sh: 1: claude: not found\n\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.324Z] [INFO] \n\n✅ Claude command completed\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.324Z] [INFO] 📊 Total messages: 0, Tool uses: 0\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.325Z] [INFO] \n🔍 Checking for uncommitted changes...\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.364Z] [INFO] ✅ No uncommitted changes found\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.365Z] [INFO]    No initial commit hash from session, attempting to detect from branch...\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.367Z] [INFO]    Attempting to detect CLAUDE.md or .gitkeep commit from branch structure...\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.465Z] [INFO]    Neither CLAUDE.md nor .gitkeep exists in current branch\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.466Z] [INFO]    Could not safely detect initial commit to revert\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.467Z] [INFO] \n=== Session Summary ===\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.468Z] [INFO] ❌ No session ID extracted\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.468Z] [INFO] 📁 Log file available: /home/hive/solve-2026-01-23T16-23-08-535Z.log\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.470Z] [INFO] \n🔍 Searching for created pull requests or comments...\n[2026-01-23T16:23:32.816Z] [INFO] \n🔍 Checking for pull requests from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d...\n[2026-01-23T16:23:33.161Z] [INFO]   ✅ Found pull request #260: \"Implement realistic velocity-based grenade throwing physics\"\n[2026-01-23T16:23:33.552Z] [INFO]   ✅ PR body already contains issue reference\n[2026-01-23T16:23:33.553Z] [INFO]   🔄 Converting PR from draft to ready for review...\n[2026-01-23T16:23:34.389Z] [INFO]   ✅ PR converted to ready for review\n[2026-01-23T16:23:34.390Z] [INFO] \n📎 Uploading solution draft log to Pull Request...\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3791073007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3791548004","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/260#issuecomment-3791548004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/260","id":3791548004,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87h_m5k","user":{"login":"konard","id":1431904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard","html_url":"https://github.com/konard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-23T18:01:20Z","updated_at":"2026-01-23T18:01:20Z","body":"🤖 **AI Work Session Started**\n\nStarting automated work session at 2026-01-23T18:01:17.365Z\n\nThe PR has been converted to draft mode while work is in progress.\n\n_This comment marks the beginning of an AI work session.

You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.\nGeneral guidelines.\n   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.\n   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:\n      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-256-a4e979be411d --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha\n      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA\n      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log\n      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures\n      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs\n      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.\n      Note: If user says \\\"failing\\\" but tools show \\\"passing\\\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\n\nInitial research.\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\n   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \\\"Could not process image\\\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \\\"HTML\\\" or \\\"text\\\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256.\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\n   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:\n      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/260/comments --paginate\n      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \\\"gh pr view --json comments\\\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256/comments --paginate.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 260 --body \\\"your message\\\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 260, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 260.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d. (Note: PR 260 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 260 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\\${owner}/\\${repo}/pulls/\\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\n\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\" | jq -c .)\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.031Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.032Z] [INFO] 📋 User prompt:\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.032Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.032Z] [INFO] Issue to solve: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256\nYour prepared branch: issue-256-a4e979be411d\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769191270424\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/260\nYour forked repository: konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\nOriginal repository (upstream): Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP\nGitHub Actions on your fork: https://github.com/konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP/actions?query=branch%3Aissue-256-a4e979be411d\n\nNew comments on the pull request: 5\nPull request description was edited after last commit\n\nContinue.\n\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.032Z] [INFO] ---END USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.032Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.032Z] [INFO] 📋 System prompt:\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.032Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN SYSTEM PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.033Z] [INFO] You are an AI issue solver.

PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256/comments --paginate.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 260 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 260, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 260.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d. (Note: PR 260 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 260 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\n\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.033Z] [INFO] ---END SYSTEM PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.033Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.034Z] [INFO] 📊 CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS: 64000\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.034Z] [INFO] 📋 Command details:          \n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.034Z] [INFO]   📂 Working directory:      /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769191270424\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.035Z] [INFO]   🌿 Branch:                 issue-256-a4e979be411d\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.035Z] [INFO]   🤖 Model:                  Claude OPUS\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.036Z] [INFO]   🍴 Fork:                   konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.036Z] [INFO] \n▶️ Streaming output:         \n\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.041Z] [INFO] /bin/sh: 1: claude: not found\n\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.043Z] [INFO] \n\n✅ Claude command completed\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.043Z] [INFO] 📊 Total messages: 0, Tool uses: 0\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.044Z] [INFO] \n🔍 Checking for uncommitted changes...\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.096Z] [INFO] ✅ No uncommitted changes found\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.097Z] [INFO]    No initial commit hash from session, attempting to detect from branch...\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.098Z] [INFO]    Attempting to detect CLAUDE.md or .gitkeep commit from branch structure...\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.186Z] [INFO]    Neither CLAUDE.md nor .gitkeep exists in current branch\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.186Z] [INFO]    Could not safely detect initial commit to revert\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.187Z] [INFO] \n=== Session Summary ===\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.187Z] [INFO] ❌ No session ID extracted\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.188Z] [INFO] 📁 Log file available: /home/hive/solve-2026-01-23T18-01-03-184Z.log\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.189Z] [INFO] \n🔍 Searching for created pull requests or comments...\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.537Z] [INFO] \n🔍 Checking for pull requests from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d...\n[2026-01-23T18:01:29.923Z] [INFO]   ✅ Found pull request #260: \"Implement realistic velocity-based grenade throwing physics\"\n[2026-01-23T18:01:30.281Z] [INFO]   ✅ PR body already contains issue reference\n[2026-01-23T18:01:30.282Z] [INFO]   🔄 Converting PR from draft to ready for review...\n[2026-01-23T18:01:31.143Z] [INFO]   ✅ PR converted to ready for review\n[2026-01-23T18:01:31.144Z] [INFO] \n📎 Uploading solution draft log to Pull Request...\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3791548990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/comments/3791690829","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/260#issuecomment-3791690829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/260","id":3791690829,"node_id":"IC_kwDOQ35BQ87iAJxN","user":{"login":"konard","id":1431904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard","html_url":"https://github.com/konard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2026-01-23T18:29:54Z","updated_at":"2026-01-23T18:29:54Z","body":"🤖 **AI Work Session Started**\n\nStarting automated work session at 2026-01-23T18:29:52.895Z\n\nThe PR has been converted to draft mode while work is in progress.\n\n_This comment marks the beginning of an AI work session.

You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.\nGeneral guidelines.\n   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.\n   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:\n      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-256-a4e979be411d --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha\n      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA\n      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log\n      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures\n      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs\n      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.\n      Note: If user says \\\"failing\\\" but tools show \\\"passing\\\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an examples and/or experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to experiments folder.\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to examples folder.\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\n\nInitial research.\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\n   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \\\"Could not process image\\\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \\\"HTML\\\" or \\\"text\\\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256.\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\n   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:\n      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/260/comments --paginate\n      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \\\"gh pr view --json comments\\\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256/comments --paginate.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 260 --body \\\"your message\\\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 260, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 260.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d. (Note: PR 260 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 260 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \\\"text\\\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\\${owner}/\\${repo}/pulls/\\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\n\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\" | jq -c .)\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.040Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.040Z] [INFO] 📋 User prompt:\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.040Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.041Z] [INFO] Issue to solve: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256\nYour prepared branch: issue-256-a4e979be411d\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1769192985950\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/260\nYour forked repository: konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\nOriginal repository (upstream): Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP\nGitHub Actions on your fork: https://github.com/konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP/actions?query=branch%3Aissue-256-a4e979be411d\n\nNew comments on the pull request: 6\nPull request description was edited after last commit\n\nContinue.\n\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.041Z] [INFO] ---END USER PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.041Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.041Z] [INFO] 📋 System prompt:\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.042Z] [INFO] ---BEGIN SYSTEM PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.042Z] [INFO] You are an AI issue solver.

PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/260/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/256/comments --paginate.\n\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 260 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\n\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 260, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 260.\n\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-256-a4e979be411d. (Note: PR 260 already exists, update it instead)\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-256-a4e979be411d.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 260 already exists for this branch.\n\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\n\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\n\nPlaywright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).\n   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.\n   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.\n   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.\n   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).\n   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.\n   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.042Z] [INFO] ---END SYSTEM PROMPT---\n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.043Z] [INFO] \n[2026-01-23T18:30:04.044Z] [INFO] 📊 CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS:
